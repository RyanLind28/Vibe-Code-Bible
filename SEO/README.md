## Principles

- Every file is **self-contained** — it should make sense on its own.
- Every file is **LLM-optimized** — structured for AI consumption with clear instructions.
- Every file is **actionable** — includes real examples, not just theory.
- Every file follows the format: **Principles → LLM Instructions → Examples**.

## Contributing

When adding or updating files:
- Keep the `Principles → LLM Instructions → Examples` format.
- Include code snippets where applicable (HTML, JSON-LD, config files).
- Add edge cases and common mistakes.
- Tag updates with the date and source.
