# Google Business Profile (GBP)

> Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) is the cornerstone of local SEO. It powers the Local Pack, Google Maps listings, and local Knowledge Panels. For businesses with a physical location or service area, GBP optimization is non-negotiable.

---

## Principles

### 1. Why GBP Matters
- **Local Pack** (the 3-pack map results) drives 42% of clicks on local SERPs
- **Google Maps** is the #1 local discovery platform
- GBP is a **free, direct ranking factor** for local searches
- GBP reviews and ratings influence both rankings and conversion

### 2. The Local Ranking Factors (Google's 3 Pillars)

| Factor | What It Means | How to Optimize |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Relevance** | How well your profile matches the search | Complete profile, accurate categories, keyword-rich description |
| **Distance** | How close you are to the searcher | Accurate address, service area settings |
| **Prominence** | How well-known your business is | Reviews, citations, backlinks, engagement |

### 3. GBP Profile Optimization Checklist
- [ ] **Business name:** Exact legal name (no keyword stuffing)
- [ ] **Primary category:** Most specific category available
- [ ] **Secondary categories:** Add all relevant (up to 10)
- [ ] **Address:** Exact, consistent with all citations
- [ ] **Phone number:** Local number (not toll-free)
- [ ] **Website URL:** Direct to homepage or location-specific landing page
- [ ] **Hours:** Accurate, including holiday hours
- [ ] **Description:** 750 chars, natural keyword inclusion, value proposition
- [ ] **Photos:** 10+ high-quality images (exterior, interior, team, products)
- [ ] **Services/Products:** List all with descriptions
- [ ] **Attributes:** Complete all relevant attributes
- [ ] **Q&A:** Seed common questions and answers

### 4. Reviews Are Critical
- Reviews are the #2 local ranking factor (after GBP signals)
- **Quantity:** More reviews = higher local rankings
- **Quality:** Higher average rating = better CTR
- **Recency:** Fresh reviews signal an active business
- **Responses:** Responding to all reviews shows engagement
- **Keywords in reviews:** Reviews mentioning services/keywords can boost relevance

### 5. Google Posts
GBP Posts are micro-content published directly to your profile:
- **What's New:** General updates (expire after 6 months)
- **Events:** Time-bound event announcements
- **Offers:** Promotions with start/end dates
- Post weekly for maximum engagement and freshness signals

### 6. Multi-Location Management
For businesses with multiple locations:
- Each location gets its own GBP listing
- Each location needs a unique landing page on your website
- Avoid duplicate content across location pages
- Use location-specific photos, reviews, and posts

## Common Mistakes
- **Keyword stuffing the business name:** "Portland Best Coffee Shop & Roastery | #1 Coffee" — this violates guidelines and risks suspension. Use your legal business name only.
- **Ignoring reviews:** Not responding to reviews (especially negative ones) signals disengagement.
- **Inconsistent NAP:** Your Name, Address, and Phone must be identical everywhere — GBP, website, Yelp, directories, social media.
- **Wrong category:** Choosing a broad category ("Restaurant") when a specific one exists ("Coffee Shop") reduces relevance.
- **Stock photos:** Use real photos of your actual business, team, and products. Stock photos hurt trust.
- **Set and forget:** GBP requires ongoing optimization — weekly posts, regular photo uploads, and review management.
