## Principles

### 1. Content Writing vs. Copywriting: Inform First, Sell Second

Content writing and copywriting are related disciplines with different primary goals. Copywriting exists to persuade: buy this, sign up for that, click here. Content writing exists to inform, educate, and build authority — with conversion as a secondary (but not accidental) outcome.

**The distinction in practice:**

| Dimension | Copywriting | Content writing |
|---|---|---|
| Primary goal | Convert (buy, sign up, click) | Inform (teach, explain, guide) |
| Tone | Persuasive, action-oriented | Educational, authoritative |
| Length | Short to medium (50–500 words) | Long-form (1,000–5,000+ words) |
| CTA placement | Prominent, repeated | Subtle, end-of-piece |
| Success metric | Conversion rate | Traffic, engagement, backlinks |
| Trust mechanism | Social proof, urgency | Expertise, depth, accuracy |
| SEO role | Landing pages, product pages | Blog posts, guides, pillar pages |

**Why the distinction matters for SEO:**

Google's Helpful Content guidance specifically targets content written "primarily for search engines rather than people." Content writing that is thinly disguised copywriting — "educational" blog posts that are really extended sales pitches — gets demoted. The content must genuinely inform. If it also happens to build your brand, earn backlinks, and drive traffic to your product pages through internal links, that is the strategy working as designed.

**The content writing mindset:** Write as if you are explaining the topic to a knowledgeable colleague who has no relationship with your product. If the content is useful regardless of whether the reader ever buys from you, you have written good content. If the content only makes sense as a preamble to your sales pitch, you have written a disguised ad.

### 2. The SEO-First Content Workflow

Writing content without an SEO strategy is like opening a store in an empty field and hoping people find it. The SEO-first workflow ensures that every piece of content targets real search demand, matches searcher intent, and has a realistic chance of ranking.

**The workflow, step by step:**

1. **Keyword research** — Identify keywords with meaningful search volume AND ranking feasibility for your domain. Not every keyword is worth targeting. A new blog should not target "project management" (too competitive) but could target "async standup tools for remote teams" (specific, achievable).

2. **Intent analysis** — For the target keyword, search it in Google and analyze the top 5 results. What format are they (listicle, how-to, guide, comparison)? How long are they? What tone do they use? This tells you what Google considers the "right" answer for this query.

3. **Content brief** — Create a structured brief (see SEO Copywriting guide) with the keyword, intent, required sections, competitive benchmarks, unique angle, and internal link targets.

4. **Writing** — Write the content following the brief. Cover every section. Meet or exceed the depth of top-ranking competitors. Add your unique angle — original data, personal experience, better examples, or a perspective competitors do not offer.

5. **On-page optimization** — Primary keyword in H1, first 100 words, one H2, and meta description. Heading hierarchy is logical. Internal links use descriptive anchor text. Images have alt text.

6. **Publication and indexing** — Publish, submit the URL to Google Search Console for indexing, and share through distribution channels (newsletter, social, outreach).

7. **Performance monitoring** — After 2–4 weeks, check rankings, impressions, and CTR in Search Console. After 1–3 months, assess whether the content needs improvement.

8. **Iteration** — Update content based on performance data. Add missing subtopics, improve headlines, refresh outdated information, add internal links from newer content.

This is not a one-time workflow. It is a continuous loop. Content is never "done" — the best-performing pages on the web are updated regularly.

### 3. Blog Post Structures That Rank

Not all blog post formats are equal in search. Certain structures consistently outperform others because they match the patterns Google's algorithms favor and the formats searchers prefer.

**How-to guides:**
- Structure: Problem statement, step-by-step process, examples, FAQ.
- Keywords: "How to [verb] [noun]" — informational intent.
- Why they rank: Google prioritizes clear, step-by-step content for how-to queries. The step structure is easy to extract for featured snippets.
- Length: 1,500–3,000 words depending on topic complexity.

**Listicles:**
- Structure: Introduction, numbered items with explanations, conclusion.
- Keywords: "[Number] [noun] for [purpose]" — informational or commercial intent.
- Why they rank: Lists are scannable, and the numbered format is frequently pulled into featured snippets. They earn more social shares than narrative formats.
- Length: 1,000–2,500 words. Each list item should be substantive (100–300 words), not a one-liner.

**Definitive guides:**
- Structure: Table of contents, comprehensive sections covering every subtopic, examples throughout, conclusion with next steps.
- Keywords: "[Topic] guide" or "complete guide to [topic]" — informational intent.
- Why they rank: Comprehensive coverage signals topical authority. These pages accumulate backlinks because they become reference resources.
- Length: 3,000–7,000+ words. These are pillar content pieces.

**Comparison posts:**
- Structure: Introduction, comparison criteria, head-to-head analysis, verdict, FAQ.
- Keywords: "[X] vs [Y]" or "best [category]" — commercial investigation intent.
- Why they rank: Comparison queries have high commercial intent, and comparison content directly answers the searcher's decision-making need.
- Length: 1,500–3,000 words with comparison tables.

**The format-intent match:** The format you choose must match the search intent. If the top 5 results for your keyword are all listicles, write a listicle. If they are all how-to guides, write a how-to guide. Going against the dominant format for a keyword means going against what Google has already determined searchers prefer.

### 4. Content Clusters and Pillar Pages in Practice

Content clusters are the organizing principle behind modern SEO content strategy. Instead of writing isolated blog posts that compete with each other for similar keywords, you create a structured cluster of interlinked content around a core topic.

**The cluster model:**

- **Pillar page** — A comprehensive, high-level page covering the broad topic. It targets the head term (high volume, high competition). Example: "SEO Copywriting: The Complete Guide."
- **Cluster pages** — Individual, focused pages covering subtopics in depth. Each targets a long-tail keyword related to the pillar. Examples: "How to Write Meta Descriptions," "SEO Content Briefs," "E-E-A-T in Copywriting."
- **Internal links** — The pillar page links down to every cluster page. Every cluster page links back up to the pillar. Cluster pages link laterally to related cluster pages.

**Why clusters work for SEO:**

Google evaluates topical authority — how comprehensively a site covers a topic — as a ranking signal. A site with one blog post about SEO copywriting has low topical authority. A site with a pillar page and 8 cluster pages, all interlinked, has high topical authority. The cluster model concentrates authority on the pillar page, which helps it rank for the competitive head term.

**Building a cluster in practice:**

1. Choose the pillar topic. It should be broad enough to support 5–15 subtopics.
2. Identify cluster keywords. Use keyword research to find long-tail terms related to the pillar.
3. Write the cluster pages first. Each cluster page targets one specific long-tail keyword.
4. Write the pillar page last (or update it after clusters are published). Link it to every cluster page.
5. Update existing content. Any old posts that fit the cluster should be updated to link to the pillar and relevant cluster pages.
6. As you publish new content, add it to the cluster and update internal links.

**Common cluster mistakes:**

- Creating a pillar page that is too thin (just a list of links to cluster pages). The pillar must be a substantial, standalone resource.
- Cluster pages that overlap (two pages targeting nearly identical keywords). Consolidate or differentiate.
- Missing internal links between cluster pages. The links are the mechanism — without them, the cluster is just a collection of unrelated posts.

### 5. Thought Leadership: Writing with Authority and Original Insight

Thought leadership content is the highest form of content writing. It goes beyond summarizing existing knowledge to offer original insight, unique data, or a distinctive perspective. It is also the content type most resistant to AI commoditization — because AI can summarize existing knowledge but cannot generate original experience.

**What makes content "thought leadership":**

- **Original data** — Research, surveys, analysis of proprietary data. "We analyzed 1M headlines — here's what gets clicked" is thought leadership. "10 headline tips" is a summary.
- **Experience-based insight** — Lessons from doing the work. "What I learned managing content for a 50K-page site" is thought leadership. "How to manage large sites" is a guide.
- **Contrarian perspectives** — Challenging conventional wisdom with evidence. "Keyword density is a myth and here's the data" is thought leadership. "Keyword density matters" is regurgitation.
- **Framework creation** — Introducing a new mental model or methodology. The "content cluster" concept was once someone's thought leadership piece before it became standard advice.

**Why thought leadership matters for SEO:**

Thought leadership content earns backlinks at a rate 5–10x higher than standard informational content. Original data gets cited. Unique frameworks get referenced. Contrarian takes get discussed and linked to. Backlinks are the strongest off-page ranking signal. Thought leadership is therefore the highest-ROI content investment for SEO.

**Writing thought leadership:**

- Start with a claim you can support with evidence. Not opinion — evidence.
- Show your work. Include the data, the methodology, the specific examples.
- Take a clear position. Thought leadership that "both sides" everything is not leadership.
- Acknowledge limitations. "This data is from SaaS companies with 10K–100K monthly visitors. Results may differ at other scales." Intellectual honesty builds credibility.

### 6. Editing and Revision: From Draft to Publication

The difference between mediocre and excellent content is editing. First drafts are for getting ideas out. Editing is for making those ideas clear, concise, and compelling. Most content teams skip meaningful editing — they run a spell check and publish. This shows.

**The three-pass editing process:**

**Pass 1: Structural edit (the big picture)**
- Does the piece answer the reader's core question in the first 200 words?
- Are the sections in the right order? Does each section build logically on the previous one?
- Is anything missing? Are there subtopics the reader would expect but that are not covered?
- Is anything redundant? Are two sections saying the same thing in different words?
- Does the conclusion deliver a clear next step or takeaway?

**Pass 2: Line edit (the prose)**
- Is every sentence clear on first read? If you have to re-read it to understand, rewrite it.
- Cut filler words: "very," "really," "basically," "actually," "in order to," "it is important to note that."
- Activate passive voice: "The report was written by the team" → "The team wrote the report."
- Shorten long sentences. If a sentence has more than 25 words, consider splitting it.
- Check transitions between paragraphs. Can the reader follow the logic from one paragraph to the next?

**Pass 3: Copy edit (the details)**
- Grammar, spelling, punctuation.
- Consistent terminology (same feature = same name everywhere).
- Consistent formatting (headings, lists, bold, code).
- Links work and point to the right destinations.
- Images have alt text.
- Meta title and description are present and correct.

**The editing mindset:** Editing is not about finding errors — it is about making every sentence earn its place. If a sentence does not add information, remove it. If a paragraph repeats the previous one, consolidate. The goal is density of value per word.

### 7. AI-Assisted Writing Workflows: When and How to Use AI

AI writing tools (Claude, GPT, Gemini) are now integral to content workflows. Used correctly, they accelerate research, outlining, and drafting. Used incorrectly, they produce generic, inaccurate content that Google's Helpful Content system is specifically designed to detect and demote.

**Where AI adds genuine value:**

- **Research and synthesis.** Ask AI to summarize competing articles, identify subtopics, and flag gaps. This accelerates the content brief process.
- **Outlining.** Give AI your content brief and ask for a detailed outline with H2/H3 structure. Use this as a starting point, then restructure based on your expertise.
- **First drafts of structured content.** Comparison tables, FAQ sections, and listicle items can be drafted by AI and refined by a human.
- **Editing and tightening.** Paste a draft and ask AI to cut word count by 20%, simplify complex sentences, or check for logical gaps.
- **Generating variations.** Ask AI for 10 headline options, 5 meta description variants, or 3 opening paragraph approaches. Select and refine the best.

**Where AI fails and human intervention is essential:**

- **Original insight and experience.** AI cannot provide original data, personal experience, or genuine thought leadership. It can only synthesize existing public knowledge.
- **Accuracy and fact-checking.** AI models hallucinate — they present plausible-sounding but false information as fact. Every claim must be verified by a human.
- **Brand voice.** Without detailed voice instructions, AI defaults to generic corporate tone. Even with instructions, it requires human review for voice consistency.
- **Nuance and judgment.** AI tends toward confident, absolute statements. Good content includes nuance: trade-offs, limitations, exceptions, and context.

**The AI content workflow:**

1. **Human:** Create the content brief (keyword, intent, outline, unique angle).
2. **AI:** Generate a first draft following the brief and voice instructions.
3. **Human:** Review for accuracy, add original insight and experience, adjust voice.
4. **AI:** Tighten prose, generate meta copy variants, suggest internal links.
5. **Human:** Final edit, fact-check claims, verify links, publish.

The human is the strategist, fact-checker, and voice guardian. The AI is the drafter and editor. Reversing these roles produces content that sounds professional but says nothing original — which is exactly what Google's algorithms are trained to detect.

### 8. Content Repurposing: One Piece, Many Channels

Content repurposing is the strategy of adapting a single piece of content into multiple formats for different channels. A 3,000-word blog post becomes a Twitter thread, a newsletter edition, a LinkedIn carousel, a podcast script, and a YouTube video script. Each format reaches a different audience segment through a different channel.

**The repurposing matrix:**

| Source format | Repurposed into | Channel |
|---|---|---|
| Blog post | Twitter/X thread | Social media |
| Blog post | Newsletter summary | Email |
| Blog post | LinkedIn carousel | Social media |
| Blog post | YouTube script | Video |
| Blog post | Podcast talking points | Audio |
| Original research | Infographic | Social, embed |
| Webinar recording | Blog post summary | Website |
| Customer interview | Case study | Website |
| FAQ answers | Short-form video (TikTok, Reels) | Social media |

**Repurposing and SEO:**

Content repurposing is not just a distribution strategy — it is an SEO strategy:

- **Social shares drive referral traffic**, which creates engagement signals for the original blog post.
- **Video content on YouTube** can rank in Google's video carousel, capturing additional SERP real estate.
- **Infographics earn backlinks** when other sites embed them with attribution.
- **Newsletter distribution** drives initial traffic to new posts, providing the engagement signals Google uses for initial ranking assessment.
- **Podcast mentions** increase branded searches, which is an authority signal.

**Repurposing workflow:**

1. Write the long-form blog post (the source piece).
2. Extract key points for a Twitter thread (same day as publication).
3. Summarize for the newsletter (next send cycle).
4. Create a LinkedIn carousel from the key points (within the week).
5. Record a video walkthrough or podcast episode (within the month).
6. Update the blog post with embeds of the video, podcast, and infographic.

### 9. Featured Snippets: Structuring Copy for Position Zero

Featured snippets are the boxed answers that appear above the first organic result in Google — "position zero." Earning a featured snippet dramatically increases visibility and traffic, even if your page does not hold the #1 position. Snippets are won through specific content formatting, not through domain authority.

**Featured snippet types and how to optimize for each:**

**Paragraph snippets** (the most common):
- Triggered by question queries ("what is," "how does," "why is").
- Google pulls a 40–60 word paragraph that directly answers the question.
- Optimization: use the question as an H2 or H3 heading. Immediately follow with a concise, direct answer in 40–60 words. Then expand with detail below.

**List snippets** (numbered or bulleted):
- Triggered by "how to," "steps to," "best [category]," "types of" queries.
- Google pulls the heading and list items from your content.
- Optimization: use the query term as a heading, followed by an ordered or unordered list with 5–8 items. Each item should be one concise line.

**Table snippets:**
- Triggered by comparison queries ("X vs Y"), data queries ("pricing of"), and classification queries.
- Google pulls table data directly from your content.
- Optimization: use a heading above a well-formatted HTML table with clear headers and 3–6 rows.

**Video snippets:**
- Triggered when Google determines a video best answers the query.
- Optimization: embed a relevant YouTube video with a transcript on the page. Use video schema markup.

**Featured snippet content patterns:**

```text
Example: Targeting the paragraph snippet for "what is a content brief"

<h2>What Is a Content Brief?</h2>
<p>A content brief is a structured planning document that defines the
target keyword, search intent, audience, required sections, competitive
benchmarks, and unique angle for a piece of content before writing
begins. It bridges keyword research and content creation.</p>

<!-- Expanded detail follows -->
<p>The typical content brief includes 8-12 sections covering...</p>
```

The direct answer (first paragraph after the heading) is 40 words — concise enough for the snippet box. The expanded detail provides depth for readers who want more.

### 10. Internal Linking Strategy Within Content

Internal links within content are the mechanism that makes content clusters work, distributes page authority across your site, and guides readers to deeper engagement. Yet most content teams treat internal linking as an afterthought — tacking links onto the end of a post rather than weaving them into the writing.

**Internal linking as a writing habit:**

The best time to add internal links is while writing, not after. As you write about a concept that is covered in depth on another page, link to it naturally. "Before writing any content, create a [content brief](link) that defines your keyword and intent." This is better for readers (they can go deeper) and better for SEO (contextual anchor text).

**Internal linking rules:**

- **Descriptive anchor text.** "Learn how to [write a content brief](link)" tells Google the linked page is about content briefs. "Click here" tells Google nothing.
- **Link to deep pages, not just the homepage.** Most internal links should point to content pages, product pages, and service pages — not the homepage, which already has plenty of authority.
- **Every new post links to 2–5 existing pages.** Build this into your content checklist.
- **Update old posts to link to new content.** When you publish a new piece, find 3–5 existing posts that mention the topic and add links to the new piece.
- **Do not over-link.** 2–5 internal links per 1,000 words is a reasonable density. Linking every other sentence creates a cluttered reading experience.
- **Link to relevant pages, not random pages.** A link should add value to the reader in context. If the reader is unlikely to click because the linked content is not relevant to what they are reading, the link is not useful.

**Internal linking and cluster authority:**

In a content cluster, internal links concentrate authority on the pillar page. The pillar links down to clusters (distributing its authority). Clusters link up to the pillar (reinforcing its topical relevance). Clusters link laterally to each other (connecting the cluster). This interconnected structure tells Google: "This site covers [topic] comprehensively, and this pillar page is the central resource."

## LLM Instructions

### 1. Writing Blog Posts from Content Briefs

When given a content brief (keyword, intent, outline, audience):

1. Match the format to the search intent (how-to, listicle, guide, comparison).
2. Write the H1 with the primary keyword near the beginning.
3. Write a compelling opening paragraph (100–150 words) that includes the keyword, states the problem or question, and previews the value of the post.
4. Follow the outline from the brief, writing each H2 section with relevant H3 subsections.
5. Include secondary keywords and semantic terms naturally.
6. Add internal link suggestions with descriptive anchor text.
7. Write for scannability: short paragraphs, bold key phrases, lists, tables where appropriate.
8. End with a clear takeaway and CTA (related content, newsletter signup, product).
9. Write the meta title (under 60 chars with keyword) and meta description (under 160 chars with keyword and CTA).

### 2. Creating Pillar Pages

When asked to create a pillar page:

1. Ask for the broad topic, target head term, and list of cluster pages (existing or planned).
2. Write the pillar as a comprehensive overview that touches every subtopic without going into full depth on any.
3. Each section should link to the corresponding cluster page for deeper coverage.
4. Include a table of contents with jump links.
5. Write 3,000–5,000 words — enough to be a standalone resource but structured to drive readers into cluster pages.
6. Optimize the pillar for the head term keyword.
7. Suggest updates to existing cluster pages to add links back to the pillar.

### 3. Editing and Improving Existing Content

When asked to edit or improve content:

1. Run a structural check: does the opening answer the core question? Are sections in logical order? Any gaps?
2. Run a line edit: cut filler, activate passive voice, shorten long sentences, improve transitions.
3. Check SEO fundamentals: keyword in H1, first 100 words, one H2, and meta description?
4. Check internal links: are there 2–5 contextual internal links with descriptive anchor text?
5. Check formatting: short paragraphs, bold key phrases, lists, tables?
6. Check featured snippet opportunities: any H2 followed by a 40–60 word direct answer?
7. Provide a before/after for the most impactful changes.
8. Estimate the improvement potential: "adding the missing [section] could help this page compete for [keyword]."

### 4. AI-Assisted Drafting and Editing

When using AI to help write content, follow this role separation:

**As drafter:** Generate content following the brief, voice instructions, and format requirements. Flag any claims that need fact-checking. Mark sections where human experience or original data should be added: "[INSERT: personal experience with X]" or "[VERIFY: this statistic]."

**As editor:** When asked to edit a draft, focus on: cutting word count by 15–20%, simplifying complex sentences, identifying logical gaps, suggesting stronger headlines and opening lines, and flagging unsupported claims.

Never present AI-generated content as final without flagging areas that need human review for accuracy, voice, and originality.

### 5. Repurposing Content Across Channels

When asked to repurpose content:

1. Read the source piece and identify the 3–5 key insights.
2. For a Twitter/X thread: write 8–12 tweets, each making one self-contained point. Start with a hook tweet.
3. For a newsletter summary: write 100–200 words capturing the core insight with a link to the full post.
4. For a LinkedIn post: write 200–300 words with a personal angle and a takeaway.
5. For a video script: write a 3–5 minute speaking outline with an opening hook, key points, and closing CTA.
6. Always link back to the original post. Repurposed content should drive traffic to the source.

  <!-- Snippet-optimized paragraph: 40-60 words, direct answer -->
  <p>
    A content brief is a planning document created before writing that
    defines the target keyword, search intent, audience, required
    sections, word count, competitive analysis, and unique angle for a
    piece of content. It bridges keyword research and content creation,
    ensuring every post is strategically aligned.
  </p>
  <p>
    Think of it as a blueprint. A developer does not start coding without
    a spec. A content writer should not start writing without a brief.
    The brief ensures the resulting content targets the right keyword,
    matches the right intent, covers the right subtopics, and has a
    realistic chance of outranking competitors.

### 3. Content Repurposing Matrix

A practical template for turning one blog post into multiple content pieces.

```text
SOURCE: Blog post — "How to Write a Content Brief" (2,000 words)

================================================================
FORMAT: Twitter/X Thread (8 tweets)
================================================================
Tweet 1 (hook):
Most blog posts fail before a word is written.

The problem isn't writing quality — it's writing without a plan.

Here's the content brief framework that makes SEO predictable:
🧵

Tweet 2:
A content brief is a planning doc created BEFORE writing.

It defines:
- Target keyword
- Search intent
- Required sections
- Competitor benchmarks
- Unique angle

Without it, you're guessing.

Tweet 3-7: [one brief section per tweet with key insight]

Tweet 8 (CTA):
I turned this into a full guide with a free YAML template.

================================================================
FORMAT: Newsletter Summary (150 words)
================================================================
Subject: The document I write before every blog post

Hey {FirstName},

Every blog post I publish starts with a 15-minute document that
isn't the blog post.

It's a content brief — a structured plan that defines the keyword,
intent, sections, and competitive angle before I write a single
word of body copy.

Since we started using briefs, our content hit rate went from ~30%
(posts that earn organic traffic) to ~70%.

The key sections: target keyword, search intent, required H2s,
competitor analysis, unique angle, and internal link targets.

I wrote up the full process with a downloadable YAML template:

================================================================
FORMAT: LinkedIn Post (250 words)
================================================================
I used to write blog posts by opening a blank document and typing.

The result: 70% of those posts never earned organic traffic.

Then I started writing content briefs — 15-minute planning docs
that define the keyword, intent, and outline before any drafting.

The result: our content hit rate jumped from 30% to 70%.

Here's what changed:

1. We stopped guessing at keywords. Every post targets a
   validated keyword with real search volume.

2. We stopped ignoring competitors. Every brief includes analysis
   of the top 5 ranking pages.

3. We started planning unique angles. If we can't add something
   new, we don't write the post.

4. We started planning internal links. Every new post connects to
   2-5 existing pages.

A content brief takes 15 minutes. A blog post that never ranks
takes 4-8 hours and returns nothing.

### 4. AI Editing Workflow Prompt Chain

A multi-step prompt chain for using AI to edit and improve content.

```text
PROMPT 1: Structural Review
============================
Read the following blog post draft. Do NOT rewrite it yet.

Evaluate the structure and answer these questions:
1. Does the opening paragraph answer the reader's core question
   within the first 100 words?
2. Are the H2 sections in the most logical order?
3. Are any important subtopics missing that a reader would expect?
4. Are any sections redundant (saying the same thing twice)?
5. Does the conclusion provide a clear takeaway and next step?

Provide a numbered list of structural issues with specific
recommendations. Do not edit the prose — only evaluate structure.

[PASTE DRAFT]


PROMPT 2: Line Edit
=====================
Based on the structural feedback, I've reorganized the draft.
Now line-edit for clarity and conciseness.

Rules:
- Cut the word count by 15-20% without losing information
- Convert passive voice to active voice
- Break sentences longer than 25 words into two sentences
- Remove filler words: "very", "really", "basically", "in order to",
  "it is important to note that", "it should be noted that"
- Remove hedging: "might", "perhaps", "it's possible that" — unless
  the uncertainty is genuine and important
- Bold the key phrase in each paragraph (the one a scanner would read)

Return the edited draft with changes tracked in comments or
highlight the most significant changes.

[PASTE REVISED DRAFT]


PROMPT 3: SEO Check
=====================
Review this blog post for SEO optimization.

Target keyword: [KEYWORD]
Secondary keywords: [LIST]

Check:
1. Is the keyword in the H1? (first 5 words preferred)
2. Is the keyword in the first 100 words of body copy?
3. Is the keyword in at least one H2?
4. Are secondary keywords used naturally in the body?
5. Is the heading hierarchy correct (H1 → H2 → H3, no skips)?
6. Are paragraphs under 4 sentences for web readability?
7. Are there featured snippet opportunities (H2 question + 40-60
   word answer)?
8. Are there 2-5 internal link opportunities (suggest anchor text)?
9. Write a title tag (under 60 chars) and meta description (under
   160 chars).

[PASTE EDITED DRAFT]


PROMPT 4: Final Quality Check
===============================
This is the final draft. Review for:

1. Factual accuracy — flag any claims that should be verified
   with a source
2. Consistency — is the same term used for the same concept
   throughout?
3. Tone — does it match this voice description: [PASTE VOICE GUIDE]
4. Completeness — does every section deliver on its heading's promise?

Flag issues only. Do not rewrite. If something needs a source,
say "[NEEDS SOURCE]" and explain what source would validate it.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Writing Without a Content Brief or Keyword

**Wrong:** Opening a blank document and writing a blog post based on a vague idea. No keyword research. No competitive analysis. No intent matching. The resulting content targets no keyword, matches no search intent, and has no strategic purpose. It might be well-written, but it will not rank.

**Fix:** Every piece of content starts with a brief: target keyword, search intent, required sections, competitive benchmarks, and unique angle. Even a 10-minute brief dramatically improves the content's chances of earning organic traffic.

### 2. Thin Content vs. Competitors

**Wrong:** Writing a 500-word blog post on a topic where the top 5 results average 2,500 words. The content is not inherently bad — it is just not deep enough to compete. Google interprets thin content as less valuable than comprehensive content for that query.

**Fix:** Analyze the top 5 results for your target keyword. Match or exceed their depth. If they average 2,500 words, aim for 2,000–3,000 with better examples, more recent data, or a unique angle. You do not need to be the longest — but you need to be thorough enough to compete.

### 3. No Internal Links

**Wrong:** A blog post with zero internal links. It is an orphaned piece of content — disconnected from the rest of the site. Google cannot understand how it relates to other content, and readers have no path to engage further.

**Fix:** Every piece of content should include 2–5 internal links to relevant pages using descriptive anchor text. When you publish new content, update 3–5 existing posts to link to the new page. This is not optional — it is the mechanism that makes content clusters work.

### 4. Publishing Unedited AI Content

**Wrong:** Using AI to generate a blog post, running spell check, and publishing. The resulting content is technically grammatical but lacks original insight, contains unverified claims, uses generic voice, and is indistinguishable from every other AI-generated article on the topic. Google's Helpful Content system is specifically designed to identify and demote this pattern.

**Fix:** AI is a drafting tool, not a publishing tool. Every AI-generated piece must be reviewed for accuracy (fact-check claims), voice (match brand tone), originality (add human experience and insight), and quality (edit for conciseness and clarity). The human is the editor and strategist — the AI is the assistant.

### 5. Orphaned Blog Posts

**Wrong:** A blog post that is not linked to from any other page on the site and does not link to any other page. It exists in isolation. Google may not even discover it through crawling, and even if it does, it receives no internal link authority.

**Fix:** Every new post must link to 2–5 existing pages. After publishing, update 3–5 existing pages to link to the new post. If the site uses content clusters, the new post should be explicitly connected to its cluster's pillar page and related cluster pages.

### 6. Not Updating Old Content

**Wrong:** Publishing content and never touching it again. Over time, information becomes outdated, competitors publish better content, and the page slowly loses its ranking. A guide written in 2023 with 2023 data and 2023 examples cannot compete with a fresh guide written in 2026.

**Fix:** Schedule quarterly content reviews. Identify underperforming content (declining traffic, dropping rankings). Update with fresh data, new examples, current best practices, and improved structure. Add a "Last updated" date. Content maintenance is often higher ROI than new content creation.

### 7. Targeting the Same Topic Multiple Times

**Wrong:** Publishing three different blog posts about "how to write meta descriptions" over 18 months. The posts cannibalize each other — Google is unsure which one to rank, so it picks none (or picks the weakest one). Your own content competes against itself.

**Fix:** One page per keyword. If you have duplicate or overlapping content, consolidate the best material into one definitive page and redirect the others. Use the content brief process to check for existing coverage before writing anything new.

### 8. Missing Featured Snippet Formatting

**Wrong:** Writing thorough, well-researched content but formatting it as dense paragraphs with no structural elements. The content might be the best answer to a question, but Google cannot extract a snippet because the answer is buried in a 200-word paragraph.

**Fix:** For every question-based keyword you target, format the answer as: question as H2/H3 heading, 40–60 word direct answer immediately below, then expanded detail. For list-based queries, use ordered/unordered lists. For comparison queries, use tables. These structures are what Google extracts for featured snippets.
