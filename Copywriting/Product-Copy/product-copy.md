# Product Copy

> Product descriptions, comparison pages, case studies, changelogs, and competitive positioning — the copy that turns features into reasons to buy and browsers into customers.

## Principles

### 1. Features vs. Benefits: Writing What Customers Care About

Features are what your product does. Benefits are why your customer cares. The gap between features and benefits is the gap between product documentation and product copy. Customers do not buy features — they buy outcomes.

**The feature-benefit translation:**

| Feature | Benefit |
|---|---|
| 256-bit AES encryption | Your data is protected by the same encryption banks use |
| Automated daily standups | Get 5 hours per week back per team |
| Real-time collaboration | See your teammate's changes instantly — no more version conflicts |
| 99.99% uptime SLA | Your app stays online even during peak traffic |
| One-click deployment | Ship to production in seconds, not hours |

**The translation formula:** "We have [feature] so you can [benefit]." If the "so you can" part is not meaningful to the customer, the feature is not worth highlighting. A 10TB storage limit is a feature. "Never worry about running out of space" is the benefit. If the audience is developers, the feature might matter. If the audience is non-technical users, only the benefit matters.

**The "So what?" test:** For every feature you list, ask "So what?" from the customer's perspective. Keep asking until you reach something the customer emotionally cares about. "We use serverless architecture." So what? "Your app scales automatically." So what? "You handle 10x traffic spikes without lifting a finger or paying for idle servers." That last answer is the benefit.

**When features matter more than benefits:**

Technical audiences (developers, engineers, IT buyers) often do want features — but they want specific, accurate features, not marketing translations. "gRPC support" means more to a backend developer than "lightning-fast API communication." Know your audience. For technical buyers, lead with accurate features and follow with benefits. For non-technical buyers, lead with benefits and make features available on click or scroll.

### 2. Product Descriptions That Rank and Convert

Product descriptions must serve two audiences: search engines (which determine whether the page appears in results) and humans (who determine whether the page converts). The descriptions that rank use keywords naturally; the descriptions that convert translate features into benefits and address objections.

**Product description structure:**

1. **Opening line** — The primary benefit in one sentence. Include the primary keyword naturally. "Pulse is an async standup tool that gives engineering teams 5 hours per week back."
2. **Problem context** — The pain the product solves. 1–2 sentences. "Daily standups eat your calendar. Async updates respect your team's focus time."
3. **Key benefits** — 3–5 bullet points translating features to outcomes. Scannable, specific, benefit-first.
4. **Social proof snippet** — One testimonial or stat. "Used by 1,200+ engineering teams."
5. **CTA** — Clear, action-oriented. "Start free trial."

**SEO considerations for product descriptions:**

- Include the primary keyword in the first sentence and in at least one subheading.
- Use secondary keywords (product category terms, related features) naturally throughout.
- Write unique descriptions for every product. Duplicate descriptions across products signal thin content to Google.
- For e-commerce: include specifications, dimensions, materials, and compatibility information. These are the terms people actually search for.
- Add schema markup (Product, Review, Offer) to product pages for rich search results.

**The unique description imperative:**

Many e-commerce sites use manufacturer-provided descriptions across thousands of product pages. Google identifies this as duplicate content and suppresses these pages. The fix: write unique descriptions that add perspective — your angle on why this product is worth buying, who it is best for, how it compares to alternatives, and what real customers say about it.

### 3. Feature Announcement and Changelog Copy

Changelogs and feature announcements are product copy that most companies treat as developer-facing documentation. They are actually marketing opportunities. Every changelog entry is a chance to reinforce your product's momentum, remind customers of value, and give advocates a reason to share.

**Changelog entry structure:**

- **Headline:** Benefit-first. "Deploy 3x faster with parallel build steps" not "Added parallel build support."
- **Context:** Why this matters. 1–2 sentences. "Large monorepos often wait 10+ minutes for sequential build steps. Parallel builds cut that to under 3 minutes."
- **What changed:** The specific feature or fix. Be precise. Developers want details.
- **How to use it:** One-line instruction or link to documentation.

**Changelog tone:**

- Be excited about big features. Restrained excitement — not "OMG AMAZING LAUNCH!!!" but "This is a big one. Here's what changed."
- Be matter-of-fact about fixes. "Fixed a bug where exports timed out on large datasets" is all you need.
- Be transparent about breaking changes. "This update changes the default export format from CSV to JSON. To keep CSV, add `format: csv` to your export config."

**Feature announcement copy (marketing email, blog post, social):**

- **Subject line / headline:** Lead with the benefit. "Parallel Builds Are Here: Deploy 3x Faster."
- **Opening paragraph:** Context + benefit. "If your builds take 10 minutes, they just got a lot faster."
- **What's new:** Feature details with a screenshot or GIF.
- **Who it's for:** "This matters most for teams with large monorepos or multi-service architectures."
- **How to try it:** Direct CTA. "Parallel builds are available now on all Team and Enterprise plans. Enable them in your build settings."
- **What's next:** Tease the roadmap if appropriate. Builds anticipation and signals momentum.

### 4. Comparison Pages: Structured for Search and Decision-Making

Comparison pages ("X vs. Y") are among the highest-converting page types because they target commercial investigation intent — people who are actively choosing between products and are close to a purchase decision. They are also SEO gold: "product A vs product B" queries have high search volume and clear intent.

**Comparison page principles:**

- **Be honest.** If the competitor is better at something, say so. Credibility on the weaknesses makes your strengths more believable. A comparison page that says "We're better at everything" is not a comparison — it is propaganda, and readers see through it.
- **Structure for scanning.** Use a comparison table with clear categories, checkmarks, and scores. The reader should be able to compare without reading paragraphs.
- **Lead with your differentiators.** Order the comparison categories so your strongest differentiators appear first.
- **Include pricing.** This is the most-searched comparison criterion. Do not hide it.
- **Add a "Best for" summary.** "Choose X if you need [use case]. Choose us if you need [different use case]." This positions you as a trustworthy advisor, not a salesperson.

**SEO for comparison pages:**

- Target "X vs Y" keywords in the title tag and H1.
- Use schema markup (FAQPage) for common comparison questions.
- Include both product names throughout the page for keyword coverage.
- Link to your product page and to the competitor's page (yes, linking to the competitor signals objectivity to both readers and Google).
- Update comparison pages whenever either product changes features or pricing. Stale comparisons lose rankings and credibility.

### 5. Case Study Copy: Problem-Solution-Result Framework

Case studies are the most persuasive form of product copy because they provide evidence from a third party. A well-written case study is simultaneously a trust signal, an objection handler, and an SEO asset.

**The Problem-Solution-Result framework:**

1. **Problem:** What challenge was the customer facing before using your product? Be specific about the pain — numbers, time wasted, money lost, frustration points.
2. **Solution:** How did your product solve the problem? What specific features or approaches were used? Include enough detail that the reader can envision themselves using the same approach.
3. **Result:** What measurable outcome did the customer achieve? Revenue impact, time saved, efficiency gained, cost reduced. Results must be quantified.

**Case study copywriting guidelines:**

- **Lead with the result in the headline.** "How Acme Corp Reduced Churn by 34% in 90 Days" is more compelling than "Acme Corp: A Case Study."
- **Use the customer's voice.** Include direct quotes. The customer's words are more credible than your narrative.
- **Be specific about the timeline.** "In the first 30 days..." gives the reader a sense of how quickly they might see results.
- **Include the "before" metrics.** The result is only meaningful in contrast. "Reduced deploy time to 3 minutes" is good. "Reduced deploy time from 45 minutes to 3 minutes" is compelling.
- **Name the customer, company, and role.** Anonymous case studies carry a fraction of the credibility of attributed ones.

**Case studies as SEO content:**

Case studies target commercial-intent keywords when structured properly. A case study titled "How [Industry] Companies Use [Product] to [Result]" can rank for queries like "[product] case study," "[industry] [product category]," and "[result] using [product category]." Include the target keyword in the title, meta description, and body. Link the case study from relevant product and feature pages.

### 6. Testimonial Curation and Copy Framing

Raw testimonials are rarely as effective as curated and framed testimonials. Curation means selecting testimonials that address specific objections, represent your target customer segments, and include specific outcomes. Framing means adding context that amplifies the testimonial's impact.

**Testimonial curation criteria:**

- **Objection coverage:** Select testimonials that address the top objections for each page. A pricing page needs testimonials about ROI. A features page needs testimonials about ease of use. A homepage needs testimonials about overall satisfaction.
- **Audience representation:** Select testimonials from customers who match your target audience. A testimonial from a Fortune 500 CTO carries weight on an enterprise page. A testimonial from a solo developer carries weight on a startup page.
- **Specificity:** Select testimonials with numbers, timelines, and concrete outcomes over vague praise.

**Testimonial framing techniques:**

- **Pull quote with context:** "Reduced deploy time by 93%" as a large pull quote, followed by the full testimonial below.
- **Categorized testimonials:** Group testimonials under headings that match objections: "On ease of setup," "On team adoption," "On ROI."
- **Before/after framing:** Show the customer's situation before and after your product. "Before: 45-min deploys. After: 3-min deploys."

### 7. Product Schema and Structured Data in Copy

Structured data (schema markup) is the layer between your product copy and how search engines present it in results. Product pages with proper schema markup can appear with rich results — star ratings, prices, availability, and review counts displayed directly in Google search results.

**Essential schema types for product pages:**

- **Product schema** — Name, description, image, brand, SKU, price, currency, availability.
- **Offer schema** (within Product) — Price, price currency, availability status, valid date range, seller.
- **Review / AggregateRating schema** (within Product) — Rating value, review count, best/worst rating.
- **FAQ schema** — For product FAQ sections. Enables FAQ rich results in search.
- **BreadcrumbList schema** — For product category navigation. Enables breadcrumb display in search results.

**How copy supports schema:**

The copy on the page and the data in the schema must match. If your schema says the price is $29/month but the page says "starting at $24/month," Google may flag the mismatch and not display the rich result. Write the copy with schema in mind — the product name, price, and availability text on the page should be the same values in the schema markup.

**Copy for rich snippet optimization:**

- Include a clear, concise product description (the first 160 characters may appear in rich results).
- Display the aggregate rating and review count prominently in copy — this matches the schema and gives Google confidence to display it.
- Use the same product name consistently across the page, the schema, and the title tag.

### 8. Commercial Intent Keywords in Product Copy

Product copy should target commercial and transactional keywords — terms that indicate the searcher is close to making a purchase decision. These keywords have lower search volume than informational terms but much higher conversion rates.

**Commercial intent keyword types:**

| Keyword pattern | Intent | Example |
|---|---|---|
| "best [category]" | Comparison shopping | "best project management tool" |
| "[product] vs [product]" | Active comparison | "Asana vs Monday" |
| "[product] pricing" | Evaluating cost | "Linear pricing" |
| "[product] review" | Seeking validation | "Notion review 2026" |
| "[product] alternative" | Open to switching | "Jira alternative" |
| "buy [product]" | Ready to purchase | "buy standing desk" |
| "[category] for [audience]" | Seeking fit | "CRM for startups" |

**Where to use commercial keywords in product copy:**

- **Product page H1 and body:** Target your product name + category term: "Pulse — Async Standup Tool for Engineering Teams."
- **Comparison pages:** Target "[competitor] vs [your product]" and "[competitor] alternative."
- **Pricing page:** Target "[your product] pricing" in the title tag and H1.
- **Category pages:** Target category-level keywords: "project management tools," "email marketing platforms."
- **Feature pages:** Target feature-specific keywords: "real-time collaboration tool," "automated standup reports."

**Commercial keyword integration rules:**

- Include the keyword in the H1, first paragraph, and meta description — but naturally.
- Do not create a page for every keyword variation. One product page can target the product name, the category term, and 2–3 feature terms simultaneously.
- Match the copy depth to the keyword's intent. "Buy standing desk" needs a product page with a buy button, not a 2,000-word guide.

### 9. Competitive Positioning Through Copy

Every product exists in a competitive context. Your product copy does not need to mention competitors by name on every page, but it should communicate your positioning — what makes you different and who you are best for — in a way that implicitly differentiates from alternatives.

**Positioning copy strategies:**

- **Category creation:** "The first async-first standup tool." Positioning yourself as the creator of a subcategory signals leadership.
- **Niche specialization:** "Built for engineering teams, not everyone." Specialization signals depth and fit.
- **Opposite positioning:** "No Gantt charts. No timelines. No busywork." Defining what you are not differentiates you from feature-heavy competitors.
- **Speed or simplicity:** "Set up in 3 minutes. No training required." Positions against complex competitors.
- **Social proof positioning:** "Used by the teams behind Stripe, Vercel, and Linear." Association with respected brands positions you in the same tier.

**Implicit vs. explicit comparison:**

- **Implicit:** "Unlike traditional project management tools, Pulse is built for async-first teams." Mentions the category without naming competitors.
- **Explicit:** "Switching from Jira? Here's why 500+ teams chose Pulse." Names the competitor and targets "[competitor] alternative" keywords.

Use implicit positioning on product pages and marketing copy. Use explicit positioning on comparison pages, migration guides, and targeted landing pages.

## LLM Instructions

### 1. Writing Product Descriptions from Feature Lists

When given a list of product features:

1. Translate each feature into a benefit using the "so you can" formula.
2. Rank benefits by customer impact (highest value first).
3. Write a product description following the structure: opening benefit line, problem context, 3–5 benefit bullets, social proof snippet, CTA.
4. Include the primary keyword in the opening sentence and one subheading.
5. For e-commerce products, include specifications alongside benefit copy.
6. If the audience is technical, lead with accurate features and follow with benefits. If non-technical, lead with benefits.

### 2. Creating Comparison Pages

When asked to write a comparison page:

1. Ask for: your product name, competitor name, target keyword ("[X] vs [Y]"), and key differentiators.
2. Structure the page with: H1 targeting the comparison keyword, introduction acknowledging both products, comparison table with 8–12 criteria, detailed analysis per criteria, "Best for" recommendation, CTA.
3. Be honest about competitor strengths. Flag areas where the competitor has an advantage.
4. Order comparison criteria so your strongest differentiators appear first.
5. Include pricing comparison.
6. Write the meta title and description targeting "[X] vs [Y]" keywords.
7. Add FAQ schema questions: "Which is better, X or Y?" "How does X compare to Y?" "Is X cheaper than Y?"

### 3. Writing Case Studies

When asked to write a case study:

1. Ask for: customer name and company, the problem they faced, what product/feature they used, the measurable results.
2. Structure as: headline (result-first), problem section (specific pain with numbers), solution section (what they did, step by step), results section (quantified outcomes), customer quote.
3. Lead the headline with the result: "How [Company] Achieved [Result] in [Timeline]."
4. Include at least one direct customer quote.
5. Make the "before" and "after" states concrete and comparable.
6. Write the case study for both conversion (persuade prospects) and SEO (target relevant keywords).

### 4. Optimizing Product Pages for E-Commerce SEO

When asked to optimize product or category pages:

1. Write unique descriptions — never use manufacturer descriptions.
2. Include the primary keyword (product name + category) in H1, first paragraph, and meta description.
3. Translate features into benefits for the body copy.
4. Suggest Product schema markup with price, availability, and reviews.
5. Write FAQ content targeting question-based keywords.
6. Recommend internal links to related products and category pages.
7. Ensure the page has enough unique text (200+ words for product pages, 300+ for category pages).

### 5. Writing Changelog Entries

When asked to write a changelog or release notes:

1. Write the headline as a benefit, not a feature name: "Deploy 3x faster" not "Added parallel builds."
2. Include brief context: why this matters and who it helps.
3. Include the technical detail: what specifically changed.
4. Include how to use it: one line or a link to documentation.
5. For bug fixes: be concise. "Fixed: exports timing out on datasets larger than 10GB."
6. For breaking changes: be explicit about what breaks and how to migrate.
7. Tone: professional excitement for features, matter-of-fact for fixes, transparent for breaking changes.

  </table>

  <h2>Where Standup Bot Wins</h2>
  <p>
    Standup Bot is simpler and cheaper if your team only needs basic
    Slack-based standups. At $3/user/month with no extras, it is a
    lightweight option for small teams that live entirely in Slack and
    do not need analytics or deep integrations.
  </p>

  <h2>Where Pulse Wins</h2>
  <p>
    Pulse is built for teams that need more than basic standup collection:
    cross-tool integrations (Jira, Linear, GitHub), unlimited searchable
    history, per-member timezone scheduling, analytics, and mobile access.
    The free tier for teams up to 10 also makes it the better choice for
    small teams evaluating async standups for the first time.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Recommendation</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Choose Standup Bot</strong> if you are a small team (under 10)
    that works only in Slack and wants the simplest possible setup.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Choose Pulse</strong> if you are a growing team, work across
    time zones, use Jira or Linear, or want analytics and history.

    <p class="eyebrow">Case Study</p>
    <h1>How Relay Cut 260 Hours of Meetings Per Year With Async Standups</h1>
    <p class="summary">
      Relay's 45-person engineering team replaced daily standup meetings
      with Pulse and recovered over 5 hours per week — without losing
      alignment or visibility.
    </p>
    <div class="meta">
      <span>Industry: Dev Tools</span>
      <span>Team: 45 engineers</span>
      <span>Time zones: 4</span>
    </div>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
      Relay's engineering team grew from 12 to 45 in 18 months. As the
      team expanded across Pacific, Eastern, GMT, and IST time zones, the
      daily standup became a logistical nightmare.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>"We tried every time slot. Someone always got a 6 AM or 11 PM
        meeting. Attendance dropped to 60%, and the people who showed up
        were resentful."</p>
      <cite>— James Park, VP Engineering at Relay</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The team calculated the cost: 45 engineers × 30 minutes/day × 5
      days/week = 112.5 hours/week in standup time. That is 5,850 hours
      per year — the equivalent of 3 full-time engineers doing nothing
      but attending standups.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
      Relay adopted Pulse as an async standup replacement. The setup
      process was straightforward:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Connected Slack</strong> — Pulse sends standup prompts
        directly in Slack DMs. No new app to learn.</li>
      <li><strong>Configured per-team schedules</strong> — Each team
        (Frontend, Backend, Infrastructure, Mobile) set their own
        standup prompt time, aligned to their primary timezone.</li>
      <li><strong>Customized questions</strong> — Instead of the default
        "what did you do / what will you do / blockers," Relay uses:
        "What shipped?", "What's in progress?", and "What needs
        help?"</li>
      <li><strong>Linked Jira</strong> — Pulse automatically pulls each
        engineer's recent Jira activity, reducing manual typing.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>The Results</h2>
    <div class="results-grid">
      <div class="result">
        <p class="number">5.2 hrs/week</p>

### 4. Changelog Entry

A feature announcement that leads with the benefit.

```markdown
## February 2026

### Parallel Builds: Deploy 3x Faster

Large monorepos and multi-service architectures often wait 10+ minutes
for sequential build steps. Parallel builds change that — Pulse now
runs independent build steps concurrently, cutting typical build times
by 60–70%.

**What changed:**
- Build steps without dependencies now execute in parallel by default.
- The build log shows a timeline view so you can see which steps run
  concurrently and identify remaining bottlenecks.
- Maximum parallelism is configurable per project (default: 4 concurrent
  steps).

**How to use it:**
Parallel builds are enabled automatically for all Team and Enterprise
plans. No configuration required — Pulse detects independent steps from
your build config. To adjust parallelism, add `max_parallel: 8` to your

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed:** CSV exports timing out on datasets larger than 10GB. Exports
  now stream to a download link instead of generating in memory.
- **Fixed:** Standup reminders sending at the wrong time for users in
  UTC+13 (Tonga, parts of NZ during daylight saving).
- **Fixed:** Analytics dashboard showing duplicate entries when a team
  member was in multiple teams.

### Breaking Change: Default Export Format

The default export format for standup data has changed from CSV to JSON.
If your workflows depend on CSV exports, add `format: csv` to your API
export requests or select CSV in the export dialog.

This change enables richer export data (nested responses, thread context)
that CSV could not represent. Most API consumers will benefit from the
structured JSON format without changes.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Feature Lists Without Benefits

**Wrong:** "256-bit AES encryption. 99.99% uptime SLA. Multi-region deployment. Automated scaling." This is a spec sheet, not product copy. The customer — especially a non-technical one — does not know why any of this matters.

**Fix:** Translate each feature: "Your data is protected by bank-grade encryption. Your app stays online, guaranteed. Global servers ensure fast load times everywhere. Traffic spikes are handled automatically." Lead with the benefit; include the feature as supporting detail.

### 2. Copying Manufacturer Descriptions

**Wrong:** Using the same product description that the manufacturer provides to all retailers. Google identifies duplicate content and suppresses pages with non-unique descriptions. Your product page competes with hundreds of identical listings.

**Fix:** Write unique descriptions that add your perspective: who the product is best for, how it compares to alternatives, what customers say about it, and what your experience with it reveals. Unique copy is an SEO requirement for product pages.

### 3. One-Sided Comparison Pages

**Wrong:** A comparison page where your product wins every category and the competitor has zero advantages. Readers are not naive — they know no product is perfect at everything. A suspiciously one-sided comparison destroys credibility.

**Fix:** Acknowledge competitor strengths honestly. "Standup Bot is simpler and cheaper for small Slack-only teams." This honesty makes your claimed advantages more believable and positions you as a trustworthy advisor.

### 4. Case Studies Without Metrics

**Wrong:** "Acme Corp loved our product and found it very helpful for their team." This is a testimonial, not a case study. There are no measurable results, no before/after comparison, and no evidence.

**Fix:** Quantify everything. "Reduced deploy time from 45 min to 3 min" (specific before/after). "95% standup response rate, up from 60%" (improvement percentage). "Recovered 260 hours per year" (annualized impact). Numbers are the difference between a story and evidence.

### 5. No Schema Markup on Product Pages

**Wrong:** A product page with excellent copy, pricing, and reviews — but no structured data markup. Google cannot generate rich results (star ratings, prices, availability) for the page. The search listing is a plain blue link competing against competitors' rich results.

**Fix:** Add Product, Offer, and AggregateRating schema to every product page. Ensure the schema data matches the visible page content. Test with Google's Rich Results Test before publishing.

### 6. Ignoring Commercial Intent Keywords

**Wrong:** All product page SEO targets the product name but ignores category keywords, comparison keywords, and "best [category]" keywords. The page ranks for branded searches but misses the much larger audience searching for category-level terms.

**Fix:** Target commercial keywords alongside your product name: "[product name] — [category keyword]" as the title tag. Create comparison pages for "[product] vs [competitor]" and "[competitor] alternative" keywords. Build category pages targeting "best [category]" terms.

### 7. Developer-Focused Changelogs

**Wrong:** Changelog entries written purely for internal developers: "Migrated build pipeline to use esbuild instead of webpack. Refactored standup collection service to use event-driven architecture." Customers do not care about internal implementation details.

**Fix:** Lead with the customer benefit: "Builds are 3x faster" (not "migrated to esbuild"). "Standup responses are processed in real-time" (not "refactored to event-driven architecture"). Include technical details for developer audiences, but the headline must be a benefit.

### 8. Testimonials Without Context

**Wrong:** "Great product!" — John D. Testimonials without full attribution, specific outcomes, or relevant context have near-zero persuasive value. They look manufactured even if they are real.

**Fix:** Full name, title, company, and a specific outcome. "Reduced our standup time from 30 min to 2 min per person" — Sarah Chen, Engineering Manager at Clearbit. The specificity and attribution make it credible.
