# Headlines & Hooks

> Headline formulas, power words, curiosity gaps, and subheadline techniques — the atomic unit of all copywriting. A great headline is the difference between content that gets read and content that gets scrolled past.

---

## Principles

### 1. Why Headlines Are the Highest-Leverage Copy

Eight out of ten people will read a headline. Two out of ten will read the rest. That ratio, attributed to advertising legend David Ogilvy, has only become more extreme in the era of infinite scrolling feeds, email inboxes, and search result pages. Your headline is not just the first thing people read — for most of your audience, it is the only thing they read.

This makes headlines the highest-leverage copy you can write. A 10% improvement in headline performance cascades through every metric downstream: open rates for emails, click-through rates for search results, scroll depth for blog posts, conversion rates for landing pages, and share rates for social media. No other single line of text has this multiplicative effect.

Headlines serve three functions simultaneously:

- **Selection** — They help the right audience self-select. A headline that speaks to senior developers will attract senior developers and repel beginners, which is exactly what you want if your content is for senior developers.
- **Promise** — They make a promise about what the reader will get. "7 CSS Tricks That Cut Load Time in Half" promises specific, actionable, measurable value. The reader knows what they are agreeing to before they commit attention.
- **Filtration** — They compete against every other headline in the environment. In a search result, your headline competes against 9 others. In a social feed, it competes against hundreds. In an inbox, it competes against 50–100. The headline must earn attention in a competitive context, not just be "good" in isolation.

The mistake most writers make is treating headlines as labels — descriptive titles that tell you what the content is about. Labels are forgettable. "Our Product Updates" is a label. "3 New Features That Will Save You 2 Hours a Week" is a headline. Labels describe; headlines compel.

### 2. Headline Formulas: PAS, AIDA, 4 U's, Before-After-Bridge

Formulas are not shortcuts for lazy writers — they are frameworks that encode decades of tested persuasion psychology. Professional copywriters use formulas as starting points, then refine for voice, audience, and context. The four most versatile headline formulas:

**PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)**

Identify a pain point, intensify it, then promise the resolution.

- **Problem:** "Spending hours writing blog posts that nobody reads?"
- **Agitate:** "Your content is invisible because your headlines fail the scroll test."
- **Solution:** "15 headline formulas that stop the scroll and earn the click."
- **Compressed into one headline:** "Your Blog Posts Are Invisible — 15 Headline Fixes That Earn the Click"

PAS works because it starts with empathy (the reader's problem), creates emotional tension (agitation), and offers relief (solution). It is especially effective for content targeting pain-aware audiences who already know they have a problem.

**AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)**

Grab attention, build interest with detail, create desire for the outcome, and prompt action.

- "Stop Guessing at Headlines [Attention] — These 7 Proven Formulas [Interest] Will Double Your Open Rates [Desire]. Try the First One Today [Action]."
- **Compressed:** "7 Proven Headline Formulas That Double Your Open Rates"

AIDA works best for sales-oriented copy where you need to move the reader from awareness to action in a single headline and subhead combination.

**4 U's (Useful, Urgent, Unique, Ultra-Specific)**

Score your headline against four criteria:

- **Useful** — Does it promise a clear benefit? "How to Write Headlines" → Useful. "Headlines" → Not useful.
- **Urgent** — Is there a reason to read now? "Before Your Next Campaign" → Urgent. No time pressure → Not urgent.
- **Unique** — Does it differentiate from competing headlines? "The Counterintuitive Headline Trick" → Unique. "Headline Tips" → Generic.
- **Ultra-specific** — Does it include concrete details? "7 Formulas" → Specific. "Some Techniques" → Vague.

A perfect headline scores high on all four. In practice, hitting three out of four produces strong results.

**Before-After-Bridge (BAB)**

Paint the reader's current state (before), show them the desired state (after), then present your content as the bridge.

- **Before:** "You are staring at a blank subject line field."
- **After:** "Your emails consistently hit 40%+ open rates."
- **Bridge:** "These 12 subject line templates are the difference."
- **Compressed:** "From Blank Subject Lines to 40% Open Rates: 12 Templates That Bridge the Gap"

BAB is powerful for transformation-focused content — how-to guides, case studies, and product copy where the value is change from a worse state to a better state.

### 3. Power Words: Emotional Triggers That Drive Clicks

Power words are emotionally charged terms that trigger psychological responses — curiosity, fear, desire, urgency, belonging, or aspiration. They transform flat headlines into compelling ones by adding emotional weight to informational content.

**Curiosity triggers:** secret, hidden, surprising, unexpected, little-known, counterintuitive, overlooked, strange, truth about, what nobody tells you

**Urgency triggers:** now, today, immediately, before, deadline, limited, last chance, running out, final, time-sensitive

**Value triggers:** free, proven, guaranteed, step-by-step, complete, ultimate, essential, definitive, comprehensive, master

**Fear/loss triggers:** mistake, avoid, never, stop, warning, risk, dangerous, costly, painful, before it's too late

**Exclusivity triggers:** insider, exclusive, behind-the-scenes, members-only, invitation, private, early access, first look

**Power words in action:**

| Flat headline | With power words |
|---|---|
| "Ways to improve your headlines" | "7 Proven Formulas to Write Headlines That Actually Convert" |
| "Email subject line tips" | "The Counterintuitive Subject Line Trick That Doubled Our Open Rate" |
| "How to use SEO in copywriting" | "The Hidden SEO Copywriting Mistake That's Killing Your Rankings" |
| "Product update" | "Early Access: The Feature You've Been Requesting for Months" |

**Rules for power words:**

- Use one or two per headline, not five. Stacking power words sounds like spam.
- The power word must be honest. "Secret" only works if the content actually reveals something non-obvious. "Guaranteed" only works if there is a genuine guarantee.
- Match the power word's emotion to the content's intent. Urgency words on an evergreen educational guide feel manipulative. Curiosity words on a breaking news story feel appropriate.

### 4. Numbers in Headlines: Why "7 Ways" Outperforms "Ways"

Numbered headlines consistently outperform unnumbered ones in click-through rates, open rates, and social shares. This is not opinion — it is one of the most replicated findings in headline testing across platforms (BuzzSumo, CoSchedule, HubSpot, Conductor research).

**Why numbers work:**

- **Specificity** — A number transforms a vague promise into a concrete one. "Tips for better copy" could mean 3 tips or 30. "7 Tips for Better Copy" sets an exact expectation.
- **Scannability** — Numbers signal that the content is structured as a list, which readers associate with scannable, easy-to-digest formatting.
- **Commitment calibration** — The reader uses the number to assess time investment. "5 Quick Fixes" feels like a 3-minute read. "47 Advanced Strategies" feels like a 30-minute commitment. The number helps the reader decide if the content is right for them right now.
- **Pattern disruption** — In a feed of text-based headlines, a numeral (7, not "seven") visually stands out. The eye is drawn to characters that break the pattern.

**Number guidelines:**

- Use numerals, not words: "7" not "seven." Numerals are more visually distinctive and take less space.
- Odd numbers outperform even numbers in most testing (7, 9, 11, 13). The hypothesis is that odd numbers feel more authentic and specific, while even numbers feel rounded and approximated.
- The sweet spot is 5–9 for most content types. Below 5 feels thin. Above 15 feels overwhelming (unless the content type warrants it, like "101 headline examples").
- The number should come first: "7 Ways to..." beats "Ways to... (7 Included)."
- Do not inflate the number artificially. If you have 5 strong points, do not pad to 10 with weak filler. Readers notice, and it undermines trust.

### 5. Curiosity Gaps: The Open Loop Technique

A curiosity gap is the space between what the reader knows and what the reader wants to know. A headline that creates a curiosity gap compels the reader to click or keep reading to close the loop. This is one of the most powerful psychological mechanisms in copywriting — and one of the most abused.

**How curiosity gaps work:**

- "The One Metric Every SaaS Founder Ignores" — The reader thinks: "What metric? Am I ignoring it?" The loop is open. They must click to close it.
- "We Changed One Word on Our CTA and Conversions Jumped 34%" — The reader thinks: "What word? What was it before?" The loop is open.
- "Google Just Changed How It Ranks Content — Here's What It Means for You" — The reader thinks: "What changed? How does it affect me?" The loop is open.

**The curiosity gap spectrum:**

- **Too small:** "Tips for Writing Better Headlines" — No gap. The reader already knows what to expect. There is no mystery to resolve.
- **Effective:** "The Headline Mistake I Made for 5 Years (And the Fix That Changed Everything)" — Clear gap. Specific enough to be credible, vague enough to compel.
- **Too large (clickbait):** "You Won't BELIEVE What Happened When She Changed Her Headline!!!" — The gap is so large that the reader suspects the payoff will not match the hype. This is the line between curiosity and clickbait.

**Rules for ethical curiosity gaps:**

- The content must close the loop. If your headline promises a revelation, the content must deliver that revelation. Unresolved curiosity gaps destroy trust.
- The gap should be narrow and specific, not broad and vague. "The one metric..." is specific. "Things you don't know about marketing..." is vague.
- Curiosity gaps work best for content, not for products. A blog post can tease "the surprising reason." A product page should be direct about what the product does.

### 6. Subheadlines: The Second Chance to Hook

The subheadline (or subhead) is the line immediately below the headline. It is your second chance to earn the reader's attention after the headline has earned their glance. In email, it is the preview text. On a landing page, it is the line below the hero headline. In a blog post, it is the opening sentence or the meta description shown in search results.

The subheadline has a different job than the headline. The headline's job is to stop the scroll and earn a glance. The subheadline's job is to convert that glance into a read.

**The headline-subhead partnership:**

- **Headline:** "Stop Losing Customers at Checkout"
- **Subhead:** "73% of carts are abandoned. These 5 checkout copy changes recovered $240K in lost revenue for our clients last quarter."

The headline creates the hook (problem + curiosity). The subhead delivers proof (statistic + specific result). Together, they create a compelling reason to keep reading.

**Subheadline patterns that work:**

- **Add specificity:** Headline is emotional/broad, subhead is specific/detailed. "Transform Your Landing Page" → "Learn the 6-section framework used by pages converting at 12%+."
- **Answer the 'so what?':** Headline makes a claim, subhead explains why it matters. "AI Is Changing SEO" → "Here's how to adapt your content strategy before your competitors do."
- **Reduce risk:** Headline makes a big promise, subhead makes it safe. "Double Your Email Open Rate" → "No tricks, no spam tactics. Just 5 subject line principles backed by 3M+ sends."
- **Qualify the audience:** Headline is broad, subhead narrows. "The Complete Guide to SEO Copywriting" → "For content marketers and founders who write their own website copy."

### 7. Headlines for Different Contexts

A headline that works in a blog post will fail as an email subject line. A landing page headline has different constraints than a social media post. Context determines format, length, tone, and strategy.

**Blog post headlines (H1):**

- Length: 50–70 characters for SEO (Google truncates long titles in search results).
- Primary keyword near the beginning for SEO.
- Should work both in search results and on the page itself.
- Formula preference: How-to, numbered lists, definitive guides.
- Example: "How to Write Meta Descriptions That Actually Get Clicks (2026)"

**Email subject lines:**

- Length: 30–50 characters (mobile truncates after ~35 characters on most devices).
- No keyword SEO constraint — optimize purely for open rates.
- Personalization (first name, company name) increases open rates when relevant.
- Preview text (preheader) is the "subheadline" of email — use it, do not waste it.
- Formula preference: Curiosity gaps, questions, numbers, personalization.
- Example: "The email I almost didn't send"

**Social media headlines:**

- Platform-specific length constraints (Twitter/X: character limit; LinkedIn: first 2 lines before "see more").
- Hooks must work in the first 5–8 words before truncation.
- Visual interrupts (numbers, line breaks, emojis) stop the scroll.
- Formula preference: Bold claims, contrarian takes, storytelling hooks.
- Example: "I spent $50K on Facebook ads before learning this lesson."

**Ad headlines (Google Ads, Meta Ads):**

- Extremely constrained character limits (Google Ads: 30 characters per headline).
- Keyword must appear for Quality Score (Google Ads).
- Benefit-focused, not feature-focused.
- Formula preference: Benefit + qualifier, social proof, urgency.
- Example: "Write Copy That Ranks — Free Trial"

**Landing page headlines:**

- Can be longer than other contexts (10–15 words is fine).
- Must communicate the core value proposition in one sentence.
- Works in partnership with a subheadline for detail.
- Formula preference: value prop + differentiator, before-after, social proof.
- Example: "The SEO Copywriting Platform That Writes Content Briefs in 60 Seconds"

### 8. H1 and H2 as SEO Headlines

Your H1 and H2 headings serve a dual purpose: they are both SEO signals and reader navigation. Getting this right means your headlines work for both Google's crawlers and human scanners simultaneously.

**The H1 as your primary SEO headline:**

The H1 tag is the strongest on-page signal for what your page is about. Google gives significant weight to the H1 when determining topical relevance.

- **One H1 per page.** This is both an SEO best practice and a semantic HTML requirement.
- **Primary keyword in the H1.** Not forced, not stuffed — but present. "How to Write SEO Copy That Ranks" is natural. "SEO Copywriting SEO Tips for SEO Writing" is spam.
- **Keyword near the beginning.** "SEO Copywriting: The Complete Guide" is stronger than "The Complete Guide to Various Aspects of SEO Copywriting and Related Topics."
- **Match the title tag closely.** The H1 and the `<title>` tag should be close variants of each other. They do not need to be identical, but they should target the same keyword and communicate the same topic.

**H2s as section-level SEO signals:**

H2 headings define the major sections of your page. Google uses them to understand the subtopics you cover, which contributes to topical depth scoring.

- **Include keyword variants in H2s.** If your primary keyword is "SEO copywriting," use related terms in H2s: "Writing Meta Descriptions," "Keyword Integration Techniques," "On-Page Copy Structure." These signal comprehensive topical coverage.
- **Make H2s descriptive, not clever.** "The Structure Secret" is clever but tells Google nothing. "On-Page Copy Structure for SEO" is descriptive and keyword-rich.
- **Use H2s to target "People Also Ask" questions.** If "how do you write SEO copy?" appears in Google's PAA box, use that question as an H2 and answer it directly below. This is a direct path to featured snippets.
- **Do not skip heading levels.** H1 → H2 → H3 is correct. H1 → H3 (skipping H2) is semantically incorrect and confuses both screen readers and crawlers.

**The balance:** Your headings need to work as both SEO signals and human navigation. The good news is that these goals align: descriptive, specific, keyword-relevant headings are also the most useful for human readers scanning a page. Write for the scanner first, then verify the keywords are present.

### 9. Social Sharing Headlines: Copy That Earns Backlinks

Headlines do not just drive clicks — they drive shares, bookmarks, and links. A headline that is compelling enough to share extends the content's reach beyond the initial audience, earning social signals and backlinks that strengthen the page's SEO authority.

**Headlines that get shared have these characteristics:**

- **Strong opinion or contrarian take** — "Keyword Density Is a Myth and Here's the Data to Prove It." People share things that challenge conventional wisdom because sharing them signals independent thinking.
- **Useful and reference-worthy** — "The Complete Checklist for SEO Copywriting (2026 Edition)." People share resources they want to bookmark or send to colleagues. Comprehensive, definitive, evergreen resources earn the most shares.
- **Emotionally resonant** — "What I Learned About Writing After 10 Years of SEO." Stories and personal insights earn shares because they connect on a human level.
- **Data-driven or original research** — "We Analyzed 1M Headlines — Here's What Gets Clicked." Original data is the most linkable content type because it becomes a citation source.

**Why this matters for SEO:**

Every share is a potential backlink. Every backlink strengthens your page's authority. Headlines that earn shares and links create a virtuous cycle: more links → higher rankings → more visibility → more shares → more links. This is why headline quality is an SEO investment, not just a copy exercise.

**Writing for shareability:**

- Make the value obvious from the headline alone. People share headlines, not articles. If the headline clearly communicates the value, it gets shared even by people who have not read the full content.
- Include a detail that makes the share feel curated. "7 Headline Formulas" is generic. "7 Headline Formulas From Advertising's Most-Copied Copywriters" is specific enough that sharing it makes the sharer look knowledgeable.
- Test headlines in social contexts before publishing. Post the headline in Slack or on Twitter. If it gets engagement there, it will likely earn shares after publishing.

## LLM Instructions

### 1. Generating Headlines from Keywords

When asked to write headlines for a page, post, or email, always start by asking for (or inferring) the target keyword and the context (blog, email, landing page, ad, social). Then generate 8–10 headline options using a mix of formulas (PAS, AIDA, 4 U's, BAB). For each headline:

- Include the primary keyword naturally (do not force-fit it).
- Score it against the 4 U's framework (Useful, Urgent, Unique, Ultra-specific).
- Keep within the character constraints for the context (60 chars for blog/SEO, 35 chars for email, 30 chars for ads).
- Vary the formula used across the set — do not generate 10 numbered-list headlines.
- Mark your top 3 recommendations and explain why each would work.

### 2. Applying Headline Formulas

When a user specifies a formula (PAS, AIDA, BAB, 4 U's), generate 3–5 headlines using that specific formula. Show the underlying structure explicitly:

- For PAS: label the Problem, Agitate, and Solution components.
- For AIDA: label the Attention, Interest, Desire, and Action components.
- For BAB: label the Before, After, and Bridge components.
- For 4 U's: rate each headline on the four criteria.

Then present the final compressed headline that a reader would see. This helps the user understand the mechanics and learn to apply the formula independently.

### 3. Writing Subheadlines

When writing landing page copy, blog intros, or email campaigns, always pair the headline with a subheadline. The subheadline should:

- Add specificity that the headline does not include (numbers, outcomes, timelines).
- Answer the reader's "so what?" or "why should I care?" question.
- Reduce perceived risk if the headline makes a bold claim.
- Be 1–2 sentences, conversational, and benefit-oriented.

Present headline and subheadline together so the user can evaluate the pairing.

### 4. Optimizing H1 and H2 for SEO

When creating page structures, blog outlines, or content frameworks:

- Write the H1 with the primary keyword near the beginning. Keep it under 70 characters.
- Write H2s that cover the major subtopics and include secondary keywords or natural variants.
- Write H3s that break down each H2 into specific, scannable points.
- Check that the heading hierarchy is logical (no skipped levels).
- Suggest "People Also Ask" questions from Google as H2/H3 candidates when the user provides a keyword.
- Ensure each heading works as both an SEO signal and a human navigation aid.

### 5. Testing and Refining Headlines

When a user presents a headline for feedback, evaluate it against:

1. **Clarity** — Is the promise clear in under 3 seconds?
2. **Keyword presence** — Does it include the target keyword (if SEO context)?
3. **Formula alignment** — Does it follow a proven formula, or is it a label?
4. **Power words** — Does it use at least one emotionally charged word?
5. **Character count** — Is it within limits for its context?
6. **Curiosity gap** — Does it create an open loop without crossing into clickbait?
7. **Subheadline pairing** — Does the subheadline add value the headline misses?

Provide a score (strong, needs work, weak) and specific rewrite suggestions. Never just say "this is good" or "this needs improvement" without concrete alternatives.

### 4. A/B Test Headline Variants

Real-world headline test pairs with analysis of what changed and why one variant outperforms.

```text
TEST 1: Blog Post (SEO + Social)
==================================
Target keyword: "content marketing strategy"

Variant A: "How to Build a Content Marketing Strategy"
Variant B: "How to Build a Content Marketing Strategy That Drives Revenue (Not Just Traffic)"

Result: Variant B — 47% higher CTR in search, 3x more social shares.

Analysis:
- Both include the primary keyword in the same position.
- Variant B adds a DIFFERENTIATOR: "Revenue (Not Just Traffic)" — this
  speaks to experienced marketers frustrated with vanity metrics.
- The parenthetical creates a CURIOSITY GAP: how is this different from
  other strategy guides?
- Variant B QUALIFIES the audience: this is for people who care about
  revenue, not beginners wanting basic traffic.


TEST 2: Email Subject Line
============================
Target: SaaS newsletter audience (product managers, developers)

Variant A: "5 Product Launch Mistakes to Avoid"
Variant B: "We botched our product launch. Here's what went wrong."

Result: Variant B — 62% higher open rate.

Analysis:
- Variant A is formulaic and generic. It reads like a hundred other
  marketing emails.
- Variant B uses STORYTELLING and VULNERABILITY. "We botched" is honest
  and unexpected from a company.
- Variant B creates a stronger CURIOSITY GAP: what went wrong? The reader
  must open to find out.
- Variant B is in lowercase — feels personal, not promotional.
- Lesson: narrative headlines outperform list headlines in email for
  engaged audiences.


TEST 3: Landing Page Hero
============================
Target keyword: "project management tool"

Variant A: "The Project Management Tool for Modern Teams"
Variant B: "Ship Projects 2x Faster — Without the Meetings"

Result: Variant B — 28% higher conversion rate (free trial signups).

Analysis:
- Variant A is a LABEL. It describes what the product is but not why
  anyone should care. It could be any PM tool.
- Variant B leads with a BENEFIT (ship 2x faster) and removes a PAIN
  (without the meetings).
- Variant B does not include the keyword "project management tool" — and
  that is correct for a landing page hero. The H1 is for conversion, not
  SEO. The keyword can go in the <title> tag and body copy instead.
- Lesson: landing page H1s should optimize for conversion. SEO keyword
  placement can happen in the title tag, meta description, and body.


TEST 4: Product Page
======================
Target keyword: "noise cancelling headphones"

Variant A: "ProSound X9 Noise Cancelling Headphones"
Variant B: "ProSound X9 — 40hr Battery, Active Noise Cancelling, Under 200g"

Result: Variant B — 19% higher add-to-cart rate.

Analysis:
- Variant A is a product name + category label. It tells the reader
  nothing they did not already know from the search result.
- Variant B uses ULTRA-SPECIFICITY: three concrete specs (40hr, noise
  cancelling, under 200g) that differentiate from competitors.
- The keyword ("noise cancelling") is still present in Variant B.
- Lesson: product page headlines should include specs and differentiators,
  not just the product name and generic category.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Clever but Unclear Headlines

**Wrong:** Prioritizing wordplay, puns, or creative flourishes over clarity. "Heading in the Right Direction" for a headline-writing guide, or "The Write Stuff" for a copywriting course. These headlines are clever in isolation but communicate nothing about the content's value.

**Fix:** Write the clearest, most specific headline first. Then — only then — see if you can add cleverness without sacrificing clarity. "How to Write Headlines That Get 2x More Clicks" is clear. "The Secret Formula Behind Headlines That Get 2x More Clicks" adds intrigue without losing clarity. "Heading in the Right Direction" is neither clear nor intriguing.

### 2. No Keyword in the H1

**Wrong:** Writing an H1 that is catchy and compelling for human readers but contains no relevant keyword. "The Art of Words That Work" as an H1 for a page targeting "SEO copywriting." Google cannot determine the page's topic from that heading, and the page misses its strongest on-page ranking signal.

**Fix:** Include the primary keyword in the H1 naturally. "SEO Copywriting: The Art of Words That Rank and Convert" includes the keyword at the beginning while maintaining a human-friendly tone. SEO and readability are not mutually exclusive.

### 3. Headlines That Don't Deliver

**Wrong:** Writing a headline that promises something the content does not deliver. "10 Headline Tricks That Will 10x Your Traffic" when the content contains generic advice that might improve traffic by 5–10%. The reader feels deceived, bounces quickly, and the high bounce rate signals to Google that the content is unsatisfying.

**Fix:** Make sure the headline's promise is met or exceeded by the content. Calibrate claims to what the content actually delivers. If your advice might double traffic, say "double." Do not say "10x" for aspirational effect.

### 4. Using the Same Formula Every Time

**Wrong:** Every blog post headline is "X Ways to Do Y." Every email is "How to [verb]." Every landing page is "The [adjective] [noun] for [audience]." Formulaic consistency becomes formulaic predictability, and predictable headlines are invisible.

**Fix:** Rotate formulas deliberately. Use PAS for one post, a question for the next, a data-driven headline for the third, and a curiosity gap for the fourth. Keep a swipe file of formulas and cycle through them.

### 5. Subheadlines as Labels, Not Hooks

**Wrong:** Using the subheadline merely to restate or categorize: "A guide to email subject lines" or "Landing page best practices." These are labels that add zero persuasive value to the headline.

**Fix:** Subheadlines should add specificity, proof, or emotional resonance. "Based on analysis of 3M+ email sends across 200 SaaS companies" is a subhead that adds credibility. "Learn the exact templates used by high-performing marketing teams" adds value.

### 6. ALL CAPS and Excessive Punctuation

**Wrong:** "THIS HEADLINE WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!" or "The MOST IMPORTANT Guide You'll EVER Read!!!" Excessive caps and punctuation signal spam to readers (and email spam filters). They feel aggressive rather than compelling.

**Fix:** Use sentence case or title case. One exclamation point is the absolute maximum (and even that should be rare). Let the words themselves create urgency, not the formatting. If you need caps and exclamation points to make a headline feel impactful, the words are not doing their job.

### 7. Headlines That Don't Match Search Intent

**Wrong:** Writing a clickbait-style curiosity headline for a page targeting a transactional keyword. "You Won't Believe What Happens When You Buy This Standing Desk" — when the searcher typed "buy standing desk" and wants a clear product page, not a mystery.

**Fix:** Match headline style to search intent. Transactional keywords need direct, benefit-focused headlines: "Ergonomic Standing Desk — Free Shipping, 30-Day Trial." Informational keywords can use curiosity and storytelling. Read the intent, write accordingly.

### 8. Ignoring Mobile Truncation

**Wrong:** Writing a 90-character email subject line that reads beautifully on desktop but truncates to "We're excited to announce our new..." on mobile, where 60–70% of emails are opened. The most compelling part of the subject — the hook — is invisible to the majority of readers.

**Fix:** Front-load the hook. Put the most compelling, curiosity-inducing, or value-communicating words in the first 30–35 characters. "3 new features that save 2hrs/week" puts the hook first. "We're excited to announce 3 new features that save 2hrs/week" buries it behind filler.
