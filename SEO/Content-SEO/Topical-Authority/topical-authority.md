# Topical Authority

> Topical authority is the depth and breadth of your site's coverage on a subject. Google rewards sites that demonstrate comprehensive expertise on a topic over sites that cover many topics shallowly.

---

## Principles

### 1. What Is Topical Authority?
Topical authority means Google trusts your site as an expert source on a specific subject. It's built by:
- **Comprehensive coverage** of a topic and its subtopics
- **Depth of content** that goes beyond surface-level information
- **Internal linking** that creates clear topical relationships
- **External validation** (backlinks from other authoritative sources in the same topic)
- **E-E-A-T signals** (author expertise, cited sources, first-hand experience)

### 2. Why It Matters More Than Ever
With Google's core ranking systems (which now incorporate the former Helpful Content System as of March 2024), topical authority is critical:
- Sites with strong topical authority rank for more keywords with less backlink dependency
- Topically authoritative sites recover faster from algorithm updates
- New content on an established topic indexes and ranks faster
- Google surfaces topically authoritative sites in AI Overviews and featured snippets

### 3. The Topical Map
A topical map is a complete plan of all content needed to comprehensively cover a topic.

### 4. Depth vs. Breadth
- **Breadth:** Cover all subtopics within your niche (complete topical map)
- **Depth:** Go deeper than competitors on each subtopic
- **Both are required** for true topical authority
- A 500-word surface-level post does NOT build authority

### 5. Building Topical Authority Over Time
1. **Research:** Map every subtopic in your niche
2. **Prioritize:** Start with foundational/pillar content
3. **Build systematically:** Cover subtopics in logical order
4. **Interlink aggressively:** Every piece should connect to the topic cluster
5. **Update continuously:** Refresh content to stay current
6. **Earn topical backlinks:** Links from sites in the same niche carry extra weight

## LLM Instructions

```
You are a topical authority strategist. When building topical authority:

1. CREATE a complete topical map:
   - Start with the core topic
   - Break into 5-10 major subtopics
   - Break each subtopic into 3-8 individual content pieces
   - Ensure every angle, question, and search intent is covered
   - Include informational, commercial, and transactional intents
   - Map each piece to a specific keyword cluster

2. AUDIT existing topical coverage:
   - Inventory all existing content on the topic
   - Map existing content to the topical map
   - Identify gaps (subtopics with no content)
   - Identify thin content (exists but lacks depth)
   - Score coverage: what % of the topical map is covered?

3. PRIORITIZE content creation:
   - Pillar content first (comprehensive hub pages)
   - High-volume, low-competition subtopics second
   - Supporting content third (fills gaps in the map)
   - Update/expand thin existing content fourth

4. DESIGN the internal linking architecture:
   - Pillar page links to all cluster pages
   - Each cluster page links back to the pillar
   - Related cluster pages cross-link to each other
   - Use descriptive anchor text with topic keywords

5. MEASURE topical authority growth:
   - Number of keywords ranked in the topic area
   - Average position for topic-related keywords
   - Share of SERP features (featured snippets, PAA)
   - Organic traffic to topic cluster
   - Topical Trust Flow (Majestic)

Output: Complete topical map with content briefs, internal linking
plan, and publication schedule.

COMPETITOR ANALYSIS:

| Site              | Articles on Topic | Subtopics Covered | Avg. Word Count | Backlinks (Topic) | Authority Score |
|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Moz.com           | 85                | 42/45             | 2,800           | 12,000             | ★★★★★           |
| Ahrefs Blog       | 62                | 38/45             | 3,200           | 8,500              | ★★★★☆           |
| Your Site         | 12                | 10/45             | 1,200           | 200                | ★★☆☆☆           |

GAP: 35 subtopics uncovered. Priority: Cover these to reach parity.

plus add unique value (original data, unique examples, tool recommendations).
```

### Example 3: Building Authority From Scratch
```
MONTH 1-2: Foundation
  - Publish pillar page: "Complete Guide to [Topic]" (5,000+ words)
  - Publish 5 foundational cluster posts (2,000+ words each)
  - Build internal linking between all 6 pages
  - Target low-competition, informational keywords

MONTH 3-4: Expansion
  - Publish 10 additional cluster posts
  - Cover commercial intent keywords (comparisons, "best of")
  - Update pillar page to link to all new content
  - Begin link building to the pillar page

MONTH 5-6: Depth
  - Publish 10 more specialized/niche subtopics
  - Add original research or data to pillar page
  - Create free tools or templates (linkable assets)
  - Earn topical backlinks from niche sites

MONTH 7+: Dominance
  - Cover every remaining subtopic in the map
  - Continuously update existing content
  - Build links to top-performing cluster pages
  - Monitor and defend rankings
```

## Common Mistakes
- **Covering too many topics shallowly:** Better to own one topic than to dabble in twenty.
- **Not interlinking:** Content islands don't build topical authority. Link everything.
- **Thin content:** Publishing short, surface-level posts dilutes your topic's perceived quality.
- **Ignoring content freshness:** Outdated content signals declining authority. Update regularly.
- **Copying competitors exactly:** Cover what they cover PLUS add unique value — original data, unique perspectives, better examples.
