# Landing Page Copy

> Hero sections, value propositions, social proof, pricing pages, long-form sales pages, and organic landing page optimization — the copy architecture that turns visitors into customers.

---

## Principles

### 1. The Anatomy of a High-Converting Landing Page

Every high-converting landing page follows a predictable structure. The specific copy varies, but the architecture is consistent across SaaS, e-commerce, services, and lead generation pages. Understanding this architecture lets you write copy that fits each section's purpose.

**The standard landing page sections, in order:**

1. **Hero section** — Headline, subheadline, primary CTA, and optional hero image. Purpose: communicate the core value proposition and prompt the primary action within the first viewport.
2. **Social proof bar** — Customer logos, review score, or key metric. Purpose: establish credibility before the visitor reads further.
3. **Problem / pain section** — Describe the problem the visitor faces. Purpose: build empathy and urgency before presenting the solution.
4. **Solution / features section** — How your product or service solves the problem. Purpose: translate features into benefits.
5. **Deep social proof** — Testimonials, case studies, or detailed reviews. Purpose: provide evidence that the solution works for people like the visitor.
6. **Objection handling** — FAQ, guarantee, or comparison section. Purpose: address reasons the visitor might hesitate.
7. **Secondary CTA** — Repeat the primary CTA with additional context. Purpose: capture visitors who needed more information before committing.
8. **Footer** — Navigation, legal links, trust badges. Purpose: provide alternative paths and final trust signals.

Not every landing page needs all eight sections. A simple lead magnet page might have only sections 1, 2, and 7. A high-ticket SaaS page might have all eight plus additional case study sections. The key is understanding what each section does so you can assemble the right combination.

**The one-page rule:** A landing page has one goal. One CTA. One audience. One offer. Every section on the page should advance the visitor toward that single action. If you have two different offers, you need two different landing pages.

### 2. Hero Section: Headline, Subhead, CTA Above the Fold

The hero section is the most important 600 pixels of your landing page. The majority of visitors will decide whether to scroll or leave based on what they see in this section. It must answer three questions instantly:

1. **What is this?** (What does the product or service do?)
2. **Why should I care?** (What benefit does it offer me?)
3. **What should I do?** (What is the next action?)

**Hero headline:**
- Lead with the benefit, not the product. "Ship 2x Faster With Fewer Meetings" not "An Async Project Management Tool."
- Be specific. Vague headlines ("Transform Your Workflow") do not convert because they do not say anything. Specific headlines ("Cut Meeting Time by 50% With Async Standup Reports") convert because they make a concrete promise.
- One sentence maximum. If you need two sentences, the first is the headline and the second is the subhead.

**Hero subheadline:**
- Adds detail the headline omits. If the headline is the benefit, the subhead is the mechanism: "Automated daily standups replace live meetings. Your team responds on their own schedule."
- Qualifies the audience: "Built for remote engineering teams of 10–200."
- Reduces risk: "Free 14-day trial. No credit card required."

**Hero CTA:**
- One primary button. "Start free trial," "Get the demo," "Download free."
- Ghost text below the button for the top objection: "No credit card required," "Takes 2 minutes," "Free forever for small teams."
- Secondary CTA (optional, less prominent): "Watch demo" or "See pricing."

**Hero image or visual:**
- Show the product in use, not an abstract illustration. A screenshot of the dashboard is more convincing than a vector graphic of people collaborating.
- If using a hero image, ensure it does not push the headline below the fold on mobile.

**Above the fold on mobile matters most.** Over 60% of web traffic is mobile. Your hero section must work on a 375px-wide screen. Test it. If the headline truncates, the CTA is invisible, or the image dominates, fix the mobile layout first.

### 3. Value Proposition Frameworks

A value proposition is the core promise of your product or service — why someone should choose you over alternatives (including doing nothing). The hero headline is the compressed expression of your value proposition. The rest of the page expands on it.

**USP (Unique Selling Proposition):**

Identify the one thing that differentiates you from every alternative. "The only project management tool built exclusively for engineering teams." The USP works when you have a clear, defensible differentiator. If you do not, do not manufacture one — use a different framework.

**AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action) for full-page structure:**

- **Attention:** Hero section — bold headline, striking visual.
- **Interest:** Problem section — describe their pain in their own words.
- **Desire:** Solution section — show how your product eliminates the pain, with proof.
- **Action:** CTA section — make the next step obvious and low-risk.

**Before-After-Bridge (BAB):**

- **Before:** "Your team spends 12 hours a week in status meetings. By Friday, nobody remembers what was decided."
- **After:** "Imagine replacing every standup with a 2-minute async update. Decisions documented. Time reclaimed."
- **Bridge:** "Pulse replaces live standups with threaded async updates. Your team responds on their schedule."

BAB works well for the hero + first section structure. The hero paints the "before," the first section paints the "after," and the product introduction is the "bridge."

**PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution):**

- **Problem:** "Managing remote teams is chaos."
- **Agitate:** "Messages get lost. Decisions are unmade. People duplicate work. And meetings eat your calendar."
- **Solution:** "Pulse organizes remote work into threads, decisions, and async standups — so your team ships instead of meeting."

PAS works when the audience is problem-aware but has not found a solution. The agitation amplifies the pain enough to motivate action.

### 4. Social Proof Sections: Testimonials, Logos, Case Studies, Numbers

Social proof is the evidence that other people — ideally people the visitor identifies with — have chosen your product and succeeded. It is the most persuasive element on a landing page after the value proposition, because it transfers the burden of proof from your marketing claims to third-party validation.

**Customer logos:**
- Place 4–6 recognizable logos in a horizontal bar below the hero.
- Format: "Trusted by teams at [Logo] [Logo] [Logo]."
- If your customers are not household names, use the category: "Trusted by 500+ SaaS companies."
- Keep logos visually consistent: grayscale, same height, same spacing.

**Testimonials:**
- Full attribution: name, title, company, and ideally a photo. Anonymous testimonials carry zero credibility.
- Specific outcomes: "Reduced our deployment time from 45 min to 3 min" not "Great product!"
- Address different objections: one testimonial about ease of use, one about ROI, one about support quality.
- Place testimonials near the sections they reinforce: a testimonial about speed near the features section, a testimonial about support near the pricing section.

**Case studies:**
- The Problem-Solution-Result framework: what challenge did the customer face, how did your product solve it, what measurable result did they achieve?
- Lead with the result: "How Acme Corp Reduced Churn by 34% in 90 Days."
- Include specific numbers: revenue impact, time saved, percentage improvement.
- Link to the full case study from the landing page summary.

**Stat bars:**
- 3–4 specific, impressive numbers: "5,000+ teams," "99.99% uptime," "3.2x faster deploys," "4.8/5 on G2."
- Round numbers feel estimated; precise numbers feel measured. "5,127 teams" feels more credible than "5,000+ teams" (though both work).
- Place below the hero or above the final CTA.

### 5. Long-Form vs. Short-Form Landing Pages

The length of your landing page should match the complexity of the decision, not your preference for brevity or verbosity.

**When to use short-form (1–2 screen heights):**
- Free offers (lead magnets, free tools, free trials with no credit card).
- Simple products with obvious value propositions.
- Visitors who already know you (retargeting, brand-aware audiences).
- Low-commitment CTAs (newsletter signup, free account).

Short-form works because the decision is low-risk. The visitor does not need extensive persuasion — they need clarity and a fast path to the CTA.

**When to use long-form (5+ screen heights):**
- Paid products, especially at higher price points ($50+/month, $500+ one-time).
- Complex products that need explanation.
- Cold traffic that does not know your brand.
- Products with multiple objections that need addressing.
- Competitive markets where differentiation requires detail.

Long-form works because the decision is high-risk. The visitor needs to understand the product, believe the claims, trust the company, and overcome objections before committing. Each section of a long-form page removes one barrier to conversion.

**The hybrid approach:**
Many effective landing pages use a short-form hero with an immediate CTA (captures high-intent visitors who are ready to act) followed by long-form content below (captures lower-intent visitors who need persuasion). This serves both audiences on one page.

### 6. Pricing Page Copy and Tier Naming

The pricing page is both a conversion page and a decision-support page. Visitors arrive with the intent to evaluate, not just to read. Every element — tier names, feature lists, CTAs, and FAQ — should make the decision easier, not harder.

**Pricing page headline:**
- Direct and confidence-building: "Simple, transparent pricing" or "Plans that grow with your team."
- Avoid clever or vague: "Invest in your future" tells the visitor nothing about pricing.

**Tier naming principles:**
- Name for the audience, not the feature set: "Starter / Team / Enterprise" (who it is for) vs. "Basic / Standard / Premium" (implied quality ranking).
- The "Most Popular" badge on the recommended tier reduces decision paralysis by 15–20% in most testing. It gives the undecided visitor a default.
- If a tier is free, call it "Free" not "Basic" — "Basic" implies limited value.

**Feature list copy:**
- Lead with differentiating features, not shared features.
- Write in benefits language: "Invite your whole team" not "User management."
- For features that need explanation, add a tooltip or one-line description.
- Use checkmarks and dashes consistently. Empty cells create ambiguity.

**Annual/monthly toggle:**
- Default to annual if you offer a discount (higher LTV for you, lower price for them).
- Show the savings explicitly: "Save 20%" or "$60/year."
- Display the per-month price even on annual plans: "$24/mo billed annually."

**Pricing FAQ:**
Address these objections:
- "Can I switch plans?" → Yes, anytime.
- "What happens when my trial ends?" → You choose to subscribe or downgrade. No surprise charges.
- "Do you offer refunds?" → Yes, 30-day guarantee.
- "Do you have discounts for startups/nonprofits?" → If yes, say how. If no, omit the question.

### 7. Objection Handling Through Copy Placement

Objections are not random — they follow a predictable pattern based on where the visitor is on the page and what stage of decision-making they have reached.

**Objection timing on a landing page:**

| Position on page | Visitor's mental state | Primary objection | Copy solution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hero section | "What is this?" | "Is this relevant to me?" | Clear value prop with audience qualifier |
| Features section | "How does it work?" | "Is this too complex?" | Benefit-focused descriptions, demo link |
| Social proof | "Does it actually work?" | "Can I trust these claims?" | Specific testimonials, named sources |
| Pricing section | "How much does it cost?" | "Is it worth the money?" | Anchoring, guarantee, ROI framing |
| Below pricing | "Should I do this now?" | "What if I regret it?" | Free trial, guarantee, "cancel anytime" |
| Final CTA | "Am I ready?" | "What happens next?" | Describe post-signup experience |

**Placement principle:** Address each objection at the moment it naturally arises, not in a dedicated "objections" section at the bottom. The visitor who has the "is this too complex?" objection in the features section may never scroll to an FAQ at the bottom.

### 8. Semantic HTML Structure for Organic Landing Pages

Landing pages built for SEO (targeting organic search traffic) need semantic HTML structure that Google can parse, not just visual polish. Many landing pages are designed for paid traffic only and are ignored by search engines because they lack crawlable structure.

**Semantic structure for organic landing pages:**

- **One H1** containing the primary keyword. This is the hero headline.
- **H2s** for major page sections: "Features," "How It Works," "Pricing," "FAQ." Include keyword variants in these headings.
- **Paragraph text** that expands on each section. Google needs text to understand the page's topic. A landing page that is all images and buttons with no body text will not rank.
- **FAQ section with schema markup** (FAQPage schema). This enables rich results in Google and captures question-based keywords.
- **Internal links** to related pages (blog posts, documentation, case studies). These distribute link equity and signal content depth.
- **Meta title and description** optimized for the target keyword. The landing page's title tag is its ad copy in search results.

**Common organic landing page mistakes:**

- All content in images (not crawlable).
- JavaScript-rendered content without server-side rendering (not indexed).
- No H1, or the H1 is the logo/brand name instead of the target keyword.
- No text content between the hero and the footer (thin content signal).
- Blocking the landing page from crawling in robots.txt (this happens more than you would expect).

**The SEO landing page balance:** An organic landing page must serve two audiences — the searcher who needs information and the visitor who needs to convert. Structure the page so the top half is conversion-focused (hero, CTA, social proof) and the bottom half is content-rich (features explained, FAQ, comparison). The searcher gets the information; the converter gets the CTA. Both are served by the same page.

### 9. Engagement Metrics and Dwell Time as SEO Signals

When a landing page ranks in organic search, its engagement metrics feed back into its ranking performance. Google observes how searchers interact with your page, and those signals influence whether you maintain, improve, or lose your position.

**Key engagement signals for organic landing pages:**

- **Click-through rate (CTR)** — Your title tag and meta description determine this. A landing page with a compelling title earns more clicks at the same position, which signals relevance.
- **Dwell time** — How long the visitor stays before returning to search. If they land and immediately bounce back to Google (pogo-sticking), it signals that the page did not match their intent.
- **Scroll depth** — How far down the visitor scrolls. Deeper scrolling correlates with content satisfaction.
- **Interaction** — Clicks on internal links, form engagement, video plays. Any interaction signals that the visitor found the page valuable.

**Copy strategies that improve engagement signals:**

- **Match the hero to the search intent.** If someone searches "best project management tools," the hero should immediately signal comparison content, not a sales pitch for one tool.
- **Use a table of contents** for long-form landing pages. Jump links let users navigate to the section they need, which increases dwell time and reduces bounce.
- **Include rich content** (comparisons, tables, FAQs) that keeps the visitor engaged. A landing page with only a hero and CTA will have low dwell time for informational queries.
- **Place internal links throughout** to related content. Visitors who click to another page on your site do not count as bounces.

The best organic landing pages convert visitors AND satisfy search intent. They rank because they engage, and they engage because they are genuinely useful.

## LLM Instructions

### 1. Building a Landing Page Copy Framework

When asked to write landing page copy, follow this process:

1. Ask for: the product/service, target audience, primary CTA, primary keyword (for organic), and any existing brand voice documentation.
2. Choose the value proposition framework (USP, AIDA, PAS, BAB) based on the audience's awareness level and the offer's complexity.
3. Write copy for each section in order: hero (headline + subhead + CTA), social proof bar, problem section, solution/features section, deeper social proof, objection handling, final CTA.
4. For each section, include inline notes on what trust signals or objection-handling elements to add.
5. If for organic search, ensure the H1 contains the keyword, H2s contain variants, and the page includes enough text content for Google to index.
6. Deliver the copy in a structured format with clear section labels so a developer can implement it directly.

### 2. Writing Hero Sections

When asked to write a hero section:

- Write 3 headline variants using different frameworks (benefit-first, PAS, BAB).
- For each headline, write a paired subheadline that adds specificity, audience qualification, or risk reduction.
- Write the primary CTA button text with ghost text.
- Write an optional secondary CTA.
- Note which headline variant is strongest and why.
- Check the headline against mobile constraints (under 10 words for single-line display on most mobile screens).

### 3. Creating Social Proof Sections

When writing social proof for landing pages:

- Suggest the type of social proof most appropriate for the context (logos for enterprise, reviews for consumer, numbers for scale, testimonials for services).
- Write 3 testimonial variants that each address a different objection (ease of use, ROI, support quality).
- Each testimonial needs: a specific result, full attribution (name, role, company), and 1–2 sentences maximum.
- Write the stat bar copy: 3–4 numbers with short descriptions.
- Format social proof for both design mockups and development implementation.

### 4. Optimizing Landing Pages for Organic Search

When asked to make a landing page SEO-friendly:

- Check for H1 with primary keyword.
- Add or improve H2 section headings with keyword variants.
- Ensure there is sufficient text content (not just images and CTAs).
- Write or improve the meta title and description.
- Suggest FAQ schema questions based on the primary keyword.
- Identify internal link opportunities to and from the landing page.
- Note any JavaScript rendering concerns for indexing.

### 5. A/B Testing Landing Page Copy

When asked to create test variants:

- Identify the highest-leverage element to test (hero headline > hero subhead > CTA > social proof).
- Write one control and one challenger, changing only the tested element.
- State the hypothesis: "If B wins, it suggests [X audience] responds better to [Y framing]."
- Suggest the minimum traffic and conversion threshold for statistical significance.
- Recommend the next test based on the hypothesis.

  </section>

  <!-- PROBLEM SECTION -->
  <section class="problem">
    <h2>Daily Standups Are Broken</h2>
    <p>
      The average engineering team spends 5 hours per week in standup
      meetings. That is 260 hours per year — per team — spent saying
      "yesterday I did X, today I'll do Y, no blockers."
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Timezone pain:</strong> Remote teams force someone into
        a 6 AM or 11 PM meeting. Every day.</li>
      <li><strong>Context switching:</strong> A 15-minute standup costs
        45 minutes when you include the focus ramp-up on both sides.</li>
      <li><strong>No record:</strong> What was decided in yesterday's
        standup? Nobody remembers. Nothing was written down.</li>

**Key decisions:** Each testimonial targets a different objection: ROI ("is it worth the money?"), ease ("is it hard to set up?"), and adoption ("will my team actually use it?"). Attribution includes name, role, company, and a relevant detail (team size). Bold text highlights the key claim within each testimonial. The format is component-based for easy implementation.

### 4. Pricing Page

### 5. Long-Form Sales Page Using PAS

A long-form landing page structure using the Problem-Agitate-Solution framework.

<!-- Long-form PAS landing page for a course or high-ticket product -->

<main>
  <!-- HERO: State the problem boldly -->
  <section class="hero">
    <h1>Your Content Is Invisible to Google (And Here's Why)</h1>
    <p class="subhead">
      You've written 50+ blog posts. You've "done SEO." You've followed

    <h2>You're Making These Mistakes (And Google Is Punishing You)</h2>

    <div class="mistake">
      <h3>Writing Without a Content Brief</h3>
      <p>
        Every post starts with a blank page and a vague idea. You write
        what feels right, hit publish, and hope Google notices. It doesn't.
        Your competitors are using structured briefs that tell them exactly
        what to cover, how long to write, and which keywords to target.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mistake">
      <h3>Targeting Keywords Nobody Searches For</h3>
      <p>
        You pick topics based on what you think your audience wants. But
        thinking isn't data. Half your posts target phrases with zero
        monthly search volume. The other half target phrases where
        page-one results have 10x your domain authority.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="mistake">
      <h3>Publishing Orphan Content</h3>
      <p>
        Your blog is a collection of disconnected posts. No pillar pages.
        No internal linking strategy. No content clusters. Google sees a
        scattered site, not a topical authority. Your competitors own the
        topic; you occasionally visit it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="agitate-summary">
      <strong>The result:</strong> months of writing, hours of effort,
      and an organic traffic line that looks like an EKG flatline. It's
      not that content marketing doesn't work. It's that undirected
      content marketing doesn't work.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Feature-Focused Headlines

**Wrong:** "An Async Communication Platform with Threaded Discussions and Integrations." This is a feature description, not a headline. It tells the visitor what the product has, not what the product does for them.

**Fix:** Lead with the benefit: "Ship Faster With Fewer Meetings." Features belong in the features section, not the headline. The headline sells the outcome; the features explain the mechanism.

### 2. No CTA Above the Fold

**Wrong:** The hero section has a headline and a paragraph but no button. The first CTA appears 3 screen-scrolls down, after the features section. Visitors who arrive ready to act have no immediate path to conversion.

**Fix:** Always include a primary CTA in the hero section. High-intent visitors should be able to convert without scrolling. Low-intent visitors will scroll for more information, but the CTA should be waiting for them when they arrive.

### 3. Social Proof Without Specificity

**Wrong:** "Thousands of happy customers!" "People love our product!" "Trusted by companies worldwide!" These are claims, not proof. They are as credible as a restaurant saying "Best food in town" on its own sign.

**Fix:** Use specific numbers ("5,127 teams"), specific names ("Sarah Chen, VP Engineering at Acme"), and specific outcomes ("Reduced deploy time from 45 min to 3 min"). Social proof is only proof when it is specific and verifiable.

### 4. Pricing Without Anchoring

**Wrong:** A single pricing tier shown at $29/month with no context. The visitor has no reference point for whether $29 is expensive or cheap for this type of tool. Every price feels high without an anchor.

**Fix:** Show multiple tiers, with the most expensive creating the anchor. Show annual vs. monthly pricing. Highlight the recommended tier. Include the savings amount. Frame the price in terms of value ("Less than one hour of developer time per month").

### 5. Too Many Competing CTAs

**Wrong:** The landing page has "Start free trial," "Book a demo," "Download whitepaper," "Read case study," "Watch video," and "Contact sales" all above the fold. The visitor faces decision paralysis and clicks nothing.

**Fix:** One primary CTA per page. One. Secondary CTAs are fine (e.g., "Watch demo" alongside "Start trial") but they should be visually subordinate. Every CTA should ultimately lead to the same conversion goal.

### 6. Not Optimized for Organic Search

**Wrong:** The landing page is a beautiful design with no H1, no body text (all images), no internal links, and no meta description. It was built for paid traffic and is invisible to organic search, missing a major traffic channel.

**Fix:** Add semantic HTML structure: H1 with keyword, H2s for sections, body text that Google can crawl. Add meta title and description. Add FAQ schema. Add internal links. The same page can serve paid and organic traffic with proper structure.

### 7. Ignoring Mobile Layout

**Wrong:** The hero section looks great on desktop with a side-by-side headline and image. On mobile, the image pushes the headline below the fold, and the CTA is invisible without scrolling. 60%+ of the audience cannot see the most important content.

**Fix:** Design mobile-first. The headline and CTA should be fully visible in the first viewport on a 375px screen. Images are secondary on mobile — they can be below the CTA or removed entirely. Test on actual mobile devices, not just browser resize.

### 8. Generic Testimonials

**Wrong:** "Great product!" — John D. "Love it!" — Anonymous. "Would recommend." — A Customer. These testimonials are worthless. They have no specificity, no attribution, and no credibility.

**Fix:** Every testimonial needs: a specific result or observation, a full name, a title and company, and ideally a photo. "Reduced our onboarding time from 2 weeks to 3 days" from "Sarah Chen, Head of Engineering at Acme Corp" is a trust signal. "Great product!" from "John D." is noise.
