# Copywriting Vibe Coding Knowledge Base

> SEO-driven copywriting for every surface — landing pages, product descriptions, email sequences, UX microcopy, and conversion flows. Feed these files to your AI coding assistant to write copy that ranks, converts, and sounds human.

---

## How to Use

1. **Pick the file(s) that match your task** from the guide list below.
2. **Copy the full `.md` contents** into your AI coding session (Claude, Cursor, Copilot, etc.).
3. **Stack multiple files** for complex tasks — the guides cross-reference each other.
4. **Describe what you're building** and the AI now has expert-level copywriting context.

**Example stacks:**

| Task | Files to stack |
|------|---------------|
| Writing a SaaS landing page | `SEO-Copywriting` + `Landing-Pages` + `Headlines-Hooks` + `CTAs-Conversion` |
| Building a product page with SEO | `Product-Copy` + `SEO-Copywriting` + `CTAs-Conversion` |
| Creating an email welcome sequence | `Email-Copy` + `Headlines-Hooks` + `Brand-Voice-Tone` |
| Writing UI copy for an app | `UX-Writing` + `Brand-Voice-Tone` + `CTAs-Conversion` |
| Building a content marketing blog | `Content-Writing` + `SEO-Copywriting` + `Headlines-Hooks` |

**Pro tip:** Start every copywriting session by pasting `SEO-Copywriting` into your AI session. It is the anchor guide — every other copywriting file builds on its principles. SEO should be at the heart of every piece of copy you write.
