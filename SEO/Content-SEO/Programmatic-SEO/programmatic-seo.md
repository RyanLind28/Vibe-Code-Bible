# Programmatic SEO

> Programmatic SEO (pSEO) is the strategy of creating large numbers of targeted landing pages at scale using templates, databases, and automation. It targets long-tail keyword patterns that would be impractical to create manually.

---

## Principles

### 1. What Is Programmatic SEO?
Instead of manually writing hundreds of pages, pSEO uses:
- A **template** (page layout with dynamic placeholders)
- A **database** (structured data that fills the placeholders)
- **Automation** (code that generates pages from template + data)

**Examples of pSEO at scale:**
- Zapier: "/apps/{app1}/integrations/{app2}" → millions of integration pages
- Nomad List: "/city/{city-name}" → cost-of-living pages for every city
- Wise: "/currency-converter/{from}-to-{to}" → every currency pair
- Yelp: "/{business-type}/near/{location}" → local business listings
- Tripadvisor: "/hotels-{city}" → hotel listings for every city

### 2. The pSEO Formula
```
Keyword Pattern + Database + Template = Thousands of Targeted Pages
```

**Keyword pattern:** "[Tool A] + [Tool B] integration"
**Database:** All combinations of tool pairs
**Template:** Integration page showing how to connect Tool A with Tool B

### 3. When to Use pSEO
Use pSEO when:
- There's a repeatable keyword pattern with many variations
- You can provide unique, useful data for each variation
- Manual content creation would be impractical (100+ pages)
- Each page can genuinely serve user intent

**Don't use pSEO when:**
- You can't provide unique value per page (thin/doorway pages = penalty)
- The pattern doesn't match real search demand
- The result would be low-quality autogenerated content

### 4. Avoiding Google Penalties
Google's core ranking systems (including the former Helpful Content System, now integrated since March 2024) and its spam policies on 'scaled content abuse' specifically target low-quality scaled content. Your pSEO pages must:
- **Provide genuine value** that a user can't get from a single generic page
- **Have unique data per page** (not just swapping a city name into identical text)
- **Match search intent** for the target keyword
- **Not be doorway pages** (thin pages designed only to funnel to one destination)

### 5. pSEO Tech Stack
| Component | Options |
|-----------|---------|
| **Data source** | Airtable, Google Sheets, PostgreSQL, API, web scraping |
| **Page generator** | Next.js, Astro, Hugo, Webflow + CMS, WordPress + ACF |

## LLM Instructions

```
You are a programmatic SEO specialist. When designing a pSEO strategy:

1. IDENTIFY the keyword pattern:
   - Analyze search demand for the pattern
   - Verify sufficient volume across variations
   - Confirm intent is consistent across variations
   - Examples of patterns:
     "[tool] alternatives"
     "[tool] vs [tool]"
     "[profession] salary in [city]"
     "[template type] template"
     "best [product] for [use case]"

2. DESIGN the database schema:
   - Define all data fields needed per page
   - Identify data sources (APIs, scraping, manual research)
   - Ensure enough unique data per page (minimum 5-10 unique data points)
   - Plan for data freshness and updates

3. BUILD the page template:
   - Hero section with dynamic title (H1 with keyword)
   - Unique data sections (stats, comparisons, details)
   - Supporting content (FAQ, related items, context)
   - Internal linking (to related pSEO pages + hub pages)
   - Schema markup (appropriate for the page type)
   - Meta title and description templates

4. ENSURE quality at scale:
   - Each page must pass the "would I bookmark this?" test
   - Minimum unique content per page (not just name-swapped text)
   - Add user-generated content where possible (reviews, comments)
   - Include dynamic data visualizations or interactive elements
   - Filter out low-volume variations (don't create pages nobody searches for)

5. HANDLE technical SEO:
   - Proper canonicalization (self-referencing)
   - XML sitemap inclusion (auto-generated)
   - Internal linking structure (connect variations)
   - Page speed (pre-render or SSG for speed)
   - Index management (noindex thin pages)

6. MONITOR AND ITERATE:
   - Track indexing rate (% of pages indexed)
   - Monitor for thin content warnings in GSC
   - A/B test template variations
   - Expand to new keyword patterns

Output: pSEO strategy with keyword pattern, database schema,
template wireframe, and implementation plan.

## Examples

### Example 1: "[Tool] Alternatives" pSEO
```
KEYWORD PATTERN: "[SaaS Tool] alternatives"
ESTIMATED PAGES: 500
ESTIMATED SEARCH VOLUME: 200-5,000 per variation

DATABASE SCHEMA:
| Field              | Source              |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| tool_name          | Manual + API        |
| tool_category      | Manual              |
| tool_description   | API / scrape        |
| tool_pricing       | Manual research     |
| alternatives[]     | Manual curation     |
| alt_name           | Manual              |
| alt_description    | Manual              |
| alt_pricing        | Manual              |
| alt_pros           | Manual              |
| alt_cons           | Manual              |
| comparison_data    | Manual + API        |

PAGE TEMPLATE:
  H1: "10 Best [Tool Name] Alternatives in 2025"
  Meta: "Looking for [Tool Name] alternatives? Compare the top 10
        alternatives with pricing, features, and honest pros/cons."

  Section 1: Quick Comparison Table
  Section 2: Why Look for Alternatives?
  Section 3: #1 Alternative — [Name] (detailed review)
  Section 4: #2 Alternative — [Name] (detailed review)
  ...
  Section N: How We Chose These Alternatives
  Section N+1: FAQ
```

### Example 2: City-Based pSEO (Next.js)
```typescript
// app/cost-of-living/[city]/page.tsx
import { getCityData, getAllCities } from '@/lib/cities'
import { Metadata } from 'next'
import { notFound } from 'next/navigation'

export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const cities = await getAllCities()
  return cities.map(city => ({ city: city.slug }))
}

export async function generateMetadata({ params }: { params: { city: string } }): Promise<Metadata> {
  const city = await getCityData(params.city)
  if (!city) return {}
  return {
    title: `Cost of Living in ${city.name} (2026) | NomadData`,
    description: `Cost of living in ${city.name}: rent $${city.avgRent}, meal $${city.avgMeal}, internet $${city.internetCost}. Compare with ${city.similarCities[0]?.name}.`,
  }
}

export const revalidate = 86400 // Refresh data daily (ISR)

export default async function CityPage({ params }: { params: { city: string } }) {
  const city = await getCityData(params.city)
  if (!city) notFound()

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Cost of Living in {city.name}</h1>
      <CostBreakdownTable data={city.costs} />
      <QualityOfLifeScore score={city.qolScore} />
      <CompareWith cities={city.similarCities} />
      <NearbyDestinations cities={city.nearby} />
      <FAQ questions={city.faq} />
    </>
  )
}
```

### Example 3: Meta Title/Description Templates
```
PATTERN: "[Tool A] vs [Tool B]"

TITLE TEMPLATE:
  "{tool_a} vs {tool_b}: Honest Comparison ({year}) | Brand"
  Characters: Dynamically calculated, truncate if > 60

DESCRIPTION TEMPLATE:
  "Compare {tool_a} vs {tool_b} on features, pricing, and ease of use.
   {tool_a} starts at ${tool_a_price}/mo, {tool_b} at ${tool_b_price}/mo.
   See which is best for {primary_use_case}."

DYNAMIC VARIABLES:
  {tool_a}: "Slack"
  {tool_b}: "Microsoft Teams"
  {tool_a_price}: "0"
  {tool_b_price}: "4"
  {year}: "2025"
  {primary_use_case}: "team communication"

RENDERED:
  Title: "Slack vs Microsoft Teams: Honest Comparison (2025) | ToolPick"
  Description: "Compare Slack vs Microsoft Teams on features, pricing, and
  ease of use. Slack starts at $0/mo, Microsoft Teams at $4/mo.
  See which is best for team communication."
```

### Example 4: Internal Linking for pSEO
```
/tools/slack/alternatives/
  → Links to: /tools/slack/vs/teams/
  → Links to: /tools/slack/vs/discord/
  → Links to: /tools/slack/pricing/
  → Links to: /categories/team-communication/ (hub page)

/tools/slack/vs/teams/
  → Links to: /tools/slack/alternatives/
  → Links to: /tools/teams/alternatives/
  → Links to: /tools/slack/vs/discord/ (related comparison)
  → Links to: /categories/team-communication/ (hub page)

/categories/team-communication/ (HUB)
  → Links to: ALL tool pages in this category
  → Links to: ALL comparison pages in this category
  → Links to: ALL alternatives pages in this category
```

## Common Mistakes
- **Thin pages:** Swapping "New York" for "Los Angeles" in identical content = doorway pages. Google will deindex them.
- **No unique data:** Every pSEO page needs genuinely unique, valuable data that justifies its existence.
- **Too many pages at once:** Launching 50,000 pages overnight looks suspicious. Ramp up gradually.
- **Ignoring indexation rate:** Monitor what % of your pSEO pages are actually indexed. Below 60% = quality problem.
- **No internal linking between variations:** pSEO pages should cross-link to related variations and hub pages.
- **Stale data:** If your pSEO pages show 2022 data in 2025, they'll lose rankings. Automate data refreshes.
