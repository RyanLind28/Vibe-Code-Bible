# SEO Copywriting

> Writing copy that ranks in search engines and converts human readers — keyword integration, content briefs, meta copy, on-page structure, and E-E-A-T signals woven into every sentence.

## Principles

### 1. Writing for Search Engines AND Humans

SEO copywriting is not a compromise between writing for algorithms and writing for people. It is the discipline of doing both simultaneously. The misconception that you must choose — stuff keywords for Google or write naturally for readers — died with Google's Helpful Content Update. Modern search algorithms reward content that satisfies user intent, holds attention, and demonstrates genuine expertise. If your copy reads like it was written for a robot, Google will treat it as low-quality content and suppress it.

The dual-audience reality works like this: search engines determine whether your content appears in results (visibility), and humans determine whether that content achieves its purpose (conversion). Neither audience is optional. A beautifully written page that nobody finds is a diary entry. A keyword-stuffed page that ranks but repels readers is a waste of a click.

**Invisible SEO** is the standard to aim for. When SEO is done well, a reader cannot tell the copy was optimized. The keywords feel natural because they are the same words the audience actually uses. The structure is scannable because scannable content is better for everyone. The headings are descriptive because descriptive headings help readers navigate. Every SEO best practice, when applied correctly, also improves the reading experience.

Google's Helpful Content guidance asks one central question: "Was this content created primarily for people, or primarily to manipulate search rankings?" If an honest answer is "for search rankings," the content will eventually be demoted. Write for the human first. Then verify the SEO fundamentals are in place. Never reverse that order.

The practical workflow is: research what your audience searches for (keyword research), understand why they search for it (search intent), write the best possible answer to their query (quality content), and then ensure search engines can find and understand your answer (on-page SEO). That last step is a checklist, not a creative process.

### 2. Search Intent Alignment in Copy

Every search query carries an intent — the reason behind the search. Misaligning your copy's tone, depth, and structure with that intent is the fastest way to earn a high bounce rate, which signals to Google that your page did not satisfy the searcher.

There are four primary intent types, and each demands a different copywriting approach:

**Informational intent** — The searcher wants to learn something. Queries like "what is conversion rate optimization" or "how to write a meta description." Your copy should educate first, sell never (or last). Use clear explanations, definitions, examples, and step-by-step instructions. The tone is authoritative but accessible. Long-form content typically wins here because the searcher wants depth. Structure with clear H2/H3 headings so the reader can scan to the section they need.

**Navigational intent** — The searcher is looking for a specific brand or page. Queries like "Stripe documentation" or "Mailchimp login." Your copy should make it immediately obvious they have found what they are looking for. Brand name prominent, clear navigation, minimal friction. There is little copywriting opportunity here beyond ensuring your brand pages rank for your own brand terms.

**Commercial investigation intent** — The searcher is researching before a purchase. Queries like "best email marketing platform 2026" or "ConvertKit vs Mailchimp." Your copy should compare, contrast, and help the reader make a decision. Use comparison tables, pros/cons lists, and honest assessments. The tone is consultative — you are a trusted advisor, not a salesperson. This is where product copy and comparison pages live.

**Transactional intent** — The searcher is ready to act. Queries like "buy standing desk" or "sign up for Notion." Your copy should remove friction, reinforce the decision, and make the action obvious. Short, direct, benefit-focused copy. Clear CTAs. Trust signals near the conversion point. Do not bury the action under paragraphs of explanation — the searcher already knows what they want.

**Matching copy tone to intent:**

| Intent | Copy Tone | Copy Length | Primary Goal |
|--------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Informational | Educational, thorough | Long-form (1,500–3,000+ words) | Teach and build authority |
| Navigational | Clear, branded | Short, direct | Confirm arrival, reduce friction |
| Commercial | Consultative, comparative | Medium-form (1,000–2,000 words) | Help decide, build trust |
| Transactional | Action-oriented, concise | Short-form, focused | Convert, remove objections |

When you write copy that matches intent, dwell time increases (readers stay longer because the content is what they expected), bounce rate decreases (readers do not hit back immediately), and engagement signals improve. These behavioral signals reinforce rankings in a positive feedback loop.

### 3. Keyword Integration That Reads Naturally

Keyword stuffing is dead. It has been dead since Google's Hummingbird update in 2013, and yet copywriters still force primary keywords into every paragraph as if density were a ranking factor. It is not. Google uses semantic understanding — it knows that "running shoes," "best shoes for running," and "jogging footwear" all mean the same thing. Your job is to cover the topic thoroughly, not to repeat a phrase mechanically.

**Primary keyword placement** — There are specific positions where your primary keyword has the most impact, not because of "density" but because these positions signal what the page is about:

- **Title tag (H1)** — Include the primary keyword, ideally near the beginning. This is the strongest on-page signal.
- **First 100 words** — Mention the primary keyword naturally within the opening paragraph. This confirms the topic for both readers and crawlers.
- **At least one H2 or H3** — Use the keyword or a close variant in a subheading. This reinforces topical relevance within the page structure.
- **URL slug** — Keep it short and keyword-relevant: `/seo-copywriting/` not `/post-12847/`.
- **Meta description** — Include the keyword so Google bolds it in results (improving visual CTR).
- **Image alt text** — Describe what the image shows using natural language that includes the keyword when relevant.

**Secondary keywords** are variations and related terms that expand your topical coverage. If your primary keyword is "SEO copywriting," secondary keywords might include "writing for search engines," "SEO content writing," "optimizing web copy," and "search engine copy." Scatter these throughout your copy where they fit naturally. They signal to Google that your page covers the topic comprehensively, not just the one phrase.

**Semantic keywords (LSI terms)** are conceptually related terms that a thorough article would naturally mention. For an SEO copywriting guide, semantic keywords include "meta descriptions," "title tags," "keyword research," "search intent," "content brief," "on-page optimization." You do not need to force these in — if you write a genuinely comprehensive guide, they appear on their own.

**The topical coverage principle:** Instead of obsessing over keyword density (which is meaningless), focus on topical coverage. Does your page answer every reasonable question a searcher might have about this topic? Does it cover subtopics that competing pages cover? Use tools like "People Also Ask" boxes in Google, competitor content analysis, and keyword clustering to identify gaps. A page that covers a topic thoroughly will naturally include the right keywords in the right proportions.

**The test for natural keyword integration:** Read your copy out loud. If any sentence sounds awkward, forced, or repetitive because of a keyword, rewrite it. If you would never say that sentence in a conversation with a colleague, it does not belong in your copy.

### 4. The Content Brief as a Copywriting Blueprint

Professional SEO copywriting does not start with a blank page. It starts with a content brief — a structured document that defines the target keyword, search intent, audience, required sections, and competitive benchmarks before a single word of body copy is written. The brief is the bridge between keyword research (an SEO task) and writing (a copywriting task).

A content brief eliminates the two most common failures in SEO copywriting: writing content that does not match search intent, and writing content that is thinner than competitors.

**Anatomy of an SEO content brief:**

- **Primary keyword** — The main term the page targets. One page, one primary keyword (with rare exceptions for very closely related terms).
- **Secondary keywords** — 5–15 related terms and variations to weave in naturally.
- **Search intent** — Informational, commercial, transactional, or navigational. This determines the tone and structure of the entire piece.
- **Target word count** — Based on competitive analysis. If the top 5 results for your keyword average 2,200 words, aim for 2,000–2,500. Do not write 500 words and expect to compete.
- **Required H2/H3 sections** — Based on what top-ranking pages cover and what "People Also Ask" questions reveal. These become your outline.
- **Competitor URLs** — The top 3–5 ranking pages. Analyze what they cover, what they miss, and where you can add unique value.
- **Unique angle** — What your page offers that competitors do not. Original data, unique perspective, better examples, more actionable advice. This is what earns links and shares.
- **Target audience** — Who is searching for this term? Their knowledge level, pain points, and what they need from this content.
- **Internal links** — Pages on your own site that should link to this new page, and pages this new page should link to. Plan the cluster before writing.
- **CTA / conversion goal** — What should the reader do after consuming this content? Subscribe, buy, read another article, download a resource?

The brief is not a constraint on creativity — it is a framework that ensures your creativity serves a strategic purpose. A writer with a good brief produces SEO-effective content faster than a writer staring at a blank page trying to guess what Google wants.

### 5. Meta Copy Mastery: Titles and Descriptions

Title tags and meta descriptions are the most constrained and highest-impact copy you will ever write. They are your content's advertisement in search results — the few words that determine whether a searcher clicks your result or scrolls past it. Organic click-through rate (CTR) is a ranking factor in the feedback loop: higher CTR leads to more traffic, which leads to more engagement signals, which reinforces rankings.

**Title tags** (the blue link in search results):

- **Character limit:** 50–60 characters. Google truncates titles longer than approximately 600 pixels wide (roughly 60 characters). A truncated title loses its impact and looks unprofessional.
- **Keyword placement:** Put the primary keyword near the beginning. Searchers scan from left to right, and Google gives slightly more weight to early words.
- **Structure formulas that work:** `Primary Keyword: Compelling Qualifier` — "SEO Copywriting: The Complete Guide for 2026." `How to [Keyword] [Benefit]` — "How to Write Meta Descriptions That Get Clicks." `[Number] [Keyword] [Promise]` — "9 SEO Copywriting Principles That Actually Rank."
- **Brand name:** Append your brand at the end with a pipe or dash: "SEO Copywriting Guide | Vibe Code Bible." If your brand is well-known, this increases CTR through recognition. If not, omit it to save character space.
- **Avoid:** ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation (!!!), clickbait that the content does not deliver on, duplicate title tags across pages.

**Meta descriptions** (the gray text below the title):

- **Character limit:** 150–160 characters. Google may rewrite your meta description if it does not match the search query — but a well-written description reduces the chance of this happening.
- **Purpose:** The meta description is an elevator pitch. It must tell the searcher exactly what they will get if they click, and make that proposition more compelling than the competing results above and below.
- **Include the primary keyword.** Google bolds the matching query terms in the description, which draws the eye and signals relevance.
- **Include a call to action.** "Learn the 10 principles..." or "Discover how to write copy that ranks and converts." Active language outperforms passive descriptions.
- **Be specific.** "This guide covers keyword integration, content briefs, meta copy, and E-E-A-T signals" is more clickable than "Learn about SEO copywriting."
- **Unique per page.** Every page on your site must have a unique meta description. Duplicate descriptions across pages signal low-quality content to Google and confuse searchers.

**The meta copy as micro-copy:** Treat title tags and meta descriptions as the most important microcopy on your site. They are read more than any other text you write — every impression in search results is a "reading" of your meta copy. A 1% improvement in CTR across thousands of impressions translates directly to more traffic without creating any new content.

### 6. On-Page Copy Structure for SEO

How you structure your copy on the page affects both search rankings and reader engagement. Google uses your heading hierarchy, paragraph structure, and content organization to understand what your page is about and how thoroughly it covers the topic. Readers use these same structural elements to scan, navigate, and decide whether to keep reading.

**Semantic HTML hierarchy:**

- **H1** — One per page. This is the page title and should contain your primary keyword. It tells both Google and readers what this page is about.
- **H2** — Major sections. These are your primary subtopics. Each H2 should cover a distinct aspect of the main topic. Use keywords and variants naturally in H2s.
- **H3** — Subsections within H2 blocks. These break down subtopics into specific points. Use them generously — they create the scannable structure that both readers and Google prefer.
- **H4 and beyond** — Use sparingly. Deep nesting suggests your content structure needs reorganization, not more heading levels.

**The inverted pyramid for web copy:** Put the most important information first. On the web, readers do not start at the beginning and read linearly to the end — they scan, skip, and leave. The first paragraph of every section should contain the key takeaway. Supporting details, nuances, and examples follow. This structure also helps Google extract featured snippets from your content, since snippet algorithms favor concise, direct answers near the top of a section.

**Scannable formatting patterns:**

- **Short paragraphs** — 2–4 sentences maximum for web copy. Dense paragraphs cause readers to bounce, especially on mobile.
- **Bullet and numbered lists** — Break complex information into scannable lists. Lists are also frequently pulled into featured snippets.
- **Bold key phrases** — Bold the most important phrase in each paragraph to create a "bold scan path" that lets readers skim and still absorb the key points.
- **Tables for comparisons** — Google can parse and display table data in featured snippets. Any time you compare options, use a table.
- **Internal jump links / table of contents** — For long-form content (1,500+ words), add a linked table of contents at the top. This improves user experience and can appear as sitelinks in search results.

**Featured snippet optimization:** Google pulls featured snippets from content that directly and concisely answers a question. To optimize for snippets:

- Use the question as an H2 or H3 heading.
- Immediately follow with a 40–60 word direct answer (the "snippet paragraph").
- Then expand with detailed explanation below.
- For list snippets, use a heading followed by an ordered or unordered list with 5–8 items.
- For table snippets, use a heading followed by a properly formatted HTML/markdown table.

### 7. E-E-A-T in Copywriting

E-E-A-T stands for Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. It is not a direct ranking factor — there is no "E-E-A-T score" in Google's algorithm. But it is the framework Google's human quality raters use to evaluate search result quality, and Google's algorithms are designed to align with these quality ratings over time. For YMYL topics (Your Money or Your Life — health, finance, legal, safety), E-E-A-T signals are especially critical.

**Experience** — Show that you (or your brand) have first-hand experience with the topic. Do not write about "the best project management tools" if you have never used any of them. Experience markers in copy include:

- Personal anecdotes and case studies ("When we migrated our 50,000-page site...")
- Screenshots and original data
- Specific, non-generic advice that could only come from doing the work
- Opinions backed by experience, not just research

**Expertise** — Demonstrate deep knowledge of the subject. Expertise shows in copy through:

- Technical accuracy and precision (correct terminology, no factual errors)
- Depth of coverage (not just surface-level summaries)
- Nuanced takes (acknowledging trade-offs, not just cheerleading)
- Citing primary sources rather than summarizing summaries

**Authoritativeness** — External signals that your content is trusted by others. This is partly off-page (backlinks, mentions, citations), but your copy contributes through:

- Author bios with relevant credentials
- Citing and linking to authoritative sources
- Being cited by others (earned through quality)
- Consistent publishing on the topic (topical authority)

**Trustworthiness** — The content and the site feel reliable. Trust signals in copy include:

- Transparent sourcing (link to claims, do not make unsupported statements)
- Clear distinction between opinion and fact
- Updated dates and "last reviewed" markers
- Contact information and real business identity
- No deceptive patterns (clickbait titles, misleading claims, hidden agendas)

**Practical E-E-A-T copywriting rules:**

- Never write "studies show" without linking to the study.
- Never claim "experts agree" without naming the experts.
- Always include an author bio with relevant experience or credentials on blog posts and articles.
- Update content regularly and display the update date prominently.
- Avoid vague superlatives like "the best" without substantiation.

### 8. Internal Linking Through Copy

Internal links are the connective tissue of your website's SEO architecture. They distribute page authority (link equity) across your site, help Google discover and understand your content hierarchy, and guide readers to related content that deepens their engagement. Yet most copywriters treat internal linking as an afterthought — throwing in a random "click here" link at the bottom of a page.

**Contextual anchor text** is the most powerful internal linking technique. The anchor text (the clickable words in a link) tells Google what the linked page is about. A link with anchor text "keyword research methodology" pointing to your keyword research guide is far more valuable than a link that says "click here" or "read more."

Rules for anchor text:

- **Descriptive and keyword-relevant** — The anchor text should describe the linked page's topic. If your keyword research guide targets the keyword "keyword research," use that phrase or a close variant as anchor text.
- **Natural within the sentence** — The link should read as part of a natural sentence. "Before writing any SEO copy, start with [solid keyword research](link)" is better than "For keyword research, [click here](link)."
- **Varied across your site** — Do not use the exact same anchor text for every internal link to a page. Use natural variations: "keyword research," "researching keywords," "finding the right keywords."
- **Not over-optimized** — If every internal link to a page uses the exact-match keyword, it looks manipulative. Mix in branded, partial-match, and natural variations.

**Cluster linking strategy:** If your site uses a content cluster model (and it should — see SEO/Content-Clusters), your internal linking should reflect the cluster structure:

- **Pillar page** links down to all cluster pages.
- **Cluster pages** link up to the pillar and laterally to related cluster pages.
- **Every blog post or content piece** should link to at least 2–3 other pages on your site.
- **New content** should always include links to existing relevant pages, and you should update older pages to link to the new content.

**Internal linking as a copywriting habit:** Do not treat internal linking as a post-writing SEO task. Build links into your writing process. As you write about a concept that is covered in depth on another page, link to it naturally. This creates a better reading experience (readers can go deeper on subtopics) and a stronger SEO architecture simultaneously.

### 9. SEO Copy for Different Page Types

Different page types serve different purposes, attract different search intents, and require different copywriting approaches. A homepage and a blog post should not sound the same. A product page and an FAQ page should not be structured the same way. Understanding the copywriting requirements for each page type is essential for site-wide SEO.

**Homepage copy:**

- Primary purpose: establish brand identity, communicate core value proposition, direct visitors to relevant sections.
- SEO focus: target your brand name and 1–2 highest-value head terms.
- Copy style: concise, benefit-focused, scannable. The homepage is a routing page, not a deep-content page.
- Common mistake: trying to rank the homepage for every keyword. Let interior pages do that work.

**Service / solution pages:**

- Primary purpose: explain what you offer and why it is the best choice.
- SEO focus: target service-specific keywords with commercial intent ("SaaS copywriting services," "ecommerce email marketing").
- Copy style: benefit-led, objection-handling, with clear CTAs. Include social proof near conversion points.
- Structure: hero with value prop, features/benefits section, social proof, FAQ, CTA.

**Blog posts / articles:**

- Primary purpose: attract informational traffic, build topical authority, earn backlinks.
- SEO focus: target long-tail informational keywords. Each post targets one primary keyword.
- Copy style: educational, thorough, structured with clear heading hierarchy.
- Structure: intro with hook, table of contents, H2 sections covering subtopics, conclusion with CTA or next steps.

**Product pages:**

- Primary purpose: convert visitors who are ready to buy or sign up.
- SEO focus: target product-specific and commercial-intent keywords. Include structured data (Product, Review schema).
- Copy style: features-to-benefits translation, social proof, trust signals. Concise but complete.
- Structure: product name (H1), description, features, benefits, reviews, FAQs, CTAs.

**Category / collection pages:**

- Primary purpose: help users browse and filter products or content.
- SEO focus: target category-level keywords ("women's running shoes," "project management tools").
- Copy style: brief introductory copy (100–300 words) above the product grid, with keyword-rich descriptions that add value.
- Common mistake: leaving category pages with zero copy. Google needs text to understand the page's topic.

**FAQ pages:**

- Primary purpose: answer common questions, capture featured snippets, reduce support load.
- SEO focus: target question-based keywords ("how much does X cost," "what is the difference between X and Y").
- Copy style: direct, concise answers. Use FAQ schema markup for rich results.
- Structure: question as H2/H3, answer immediately following, 40–100 words per answer.

**About pages:**

- Primary purpose: build trust and E-E-A-T signals.
- SEO focus: brand terms and "about [brand]" queries.
- Copy style: authentic, specific, credibility-building. Include team bios with relevant expertise.
- E-E-A-T value: this page is where Google looks for evidence of who is behind the content.

### 10. Measuring SEO Copy Performance

Writing SEO copy without measuring its performance is like running ads without tracking conversions — you are spending effort with no feedback loop. Measurement tells you which pages are working, which need improvement, and where your strategy has gaps.

**Key metrics for SEO copywriting:**

- **Organic traffic** — The number of visits from organic search. Measured in Google Analytics (GA4) or your analytics platform. This is the top-level metric: is your copy attracting search traffic?
- **Organic click-through rate (CTR)** — The percentage of impressions that result in clicks. Measured in Google Search Console. Low CTR relative to your position means your title tag and meta description need improvement. Average CTR benchmarks: position 1 = ~28%, position 2 = ~15%, position 3 = ~11%.
- **Average position** — Your average ranking for a given keyword. Tracked in Google Search Console. Improving position is the goal of on-page optimization.
- **Bounce rate / engagement rate** — In GA4, engagement rate replaced bounce rate. A low engagement rate (users leave quickly without interacting) signals that your content does not match the searcher's intent.
- **Dwell time / time on page** — How long users spend on the page before returning to search results. Longer dwell time signals content satisfaction. Note: this is not directly measurable in GA4 as "dwell time" but "average engagement time" is a useful proxy.
- **Scroll depth** — How far down the page users scroll. If 80% of users never scroll past the first fold, your opening copy is not compelling enough, or the page layout is confusing. Track with GA4 scroll events.
- **Conversions from organic traffic** — The ultimate metric: are organic visitors taking the desired action? Set up conversion tracking in GA4 for newsletter signups, purchases, demo requests, or whatever your CTA is.

**Google Search Console insights for copywriters:**

- **Queries report** — Shows which keywords your pages appear for in search. Look for queries where you have high impressions but low CTR — these are title/meta optimization opportunities.
- **Pages report** — Shows which pages get the most organic traffic. Identify top performers and replicate their patterns.
- **CTR by position** — Filter by position ranges. If you rank position 1–3 but have below-average CTR, your meta copy is underperforming.
- **Impressions without clicks** — Keywords where you appear but get zero clicks. Either the keyword is irrelevant, or your listing is not compelling enough.

**The SEO copywriting feedback loop:**

1. Write content following your brief.
2. Publish and submit to Google Search Console for indexing.
3. Wait 2–4 weeks for initial ranking data.
4. Analyze performance (position, CTR, engagement).
5. Identify underperforming elements (title, description, content depth, structure).
6. Revise and republish.
7. Repeat.

Content is never "done." The best-performing pages on the web are continuously updated and improved based on performance data.

## LLM Instructions

### 1. Writing SEO Web Copy

When asked to write web copy (landing page, blog post, product page, service page, or any page intended to rank in search), always follow this process:

Ask for or identify the primary keyword, secondary keywords, and search intent before writing. If the user does not provide a keyword, ask: "What keyword or topic should this page target?" Do not write SEO copy without a target keyword.

Structure the copy with a clear semantic heading hierarchy: one H1 containing the primary keyword, H2s for major sections, H3s for subsections. Every H2 and H3 should be descriptive and scannable — never use vague headings like "More Info" or "Details."

Place the primary keyword in the H1, within the first 100 words, in at least one H2, and in the meta description. Use secondary keywords and semantic variations naturally throughout the body. Never repeat the primary keyword unnaturally or exceed what sounds conversational.

Write in short paragraphs (2–4 sentences for web). Use bullet lists, numbered lists, bold key phrases, and tables where they improve scannability. Assume the reader is scanning on a mobile device.

Match the copy tone and depth to the search intent: educational and thorough for informational queries, concise and action-oriented for transactional queries, comparative and consultative for commercial investigation queries.

Include internal link suggestions using contextual anchor text. When mentioning a concept covered by another page, suggest a link with descriptive anchor text.

End with a clear CTA that matches the page type and search intent.

### 2. Creating SEO Content Briefs

When asked to create a content brief, produce a structured document with these sections:

- **Primary keyword** — one main keyword.
- **Secondary keywords** — 5–15 related terms and variations.
- **Search intent** — classify as informational, commercial, transactional, or navigational, and explain why.
- **Target audience** — who is searching for this, their knowledge level, and their pain points.
- **Suggested word count** — based on the depth of topic (1,000–3,000+ words).
- **Required H2 sections** — outline of major sections the content must cover.
- **Suggested H3 subsections** — breakdown of each H2 into specific points.
- **Competitor notes** — what top results cover and where gaps exist (ask the user for competitor URLs or note this section needs research).
- **Unique angle** — what makes this content different from existing results.
- **Internal link targets** — pages to link to and from.
- **CTA / conversion goal** — what the reader should do after reading.

Format the brief in YAML or markdown with clear labels. The brief should be directly usable as a writing outline.

### 3. Optimizing Existing Copy for SEO

When asked to optimize existing copy, follow this audit process:

1. Identify the target keyword (ask if not provided).
2. Check keyword placement: is it in the H1, first 100 words, at least one H2, and meta description?
3. Assess heading hierarchy: is there a logical H1 > H2 > H3 structure?
4. Evaluate content depth: does the copy cover the topic thoroughly enough to compete with top-ranking pages?
5. Check for natural keyword integration vs. stuffing.
6. Look for missing internal link opportunities.
7. Assess readability: paragraph length, use of lists, bold key phrases, scannable structure.
8. Check meta copy: is the title tag under 60 characters with the keyword near the front? Is the meta description under 160 characters with a keyword and CTA?
9. Identify E-E-A-T gaps: missing author bio, unsourced claims, vague superlatives, no update date.
10. Provide specific, actionable recommendations with rewritten examples.

Present findings as a prioritized list: critical issues first (missing keyword in H1, no meta description), then improvements (better heading structure, internal links), then enhancements (featured snippet formatting, schema suggestions).

### 4. Writing Meta Copy (Title Tags and Meta Descriptions)

When asked to write title tags and meta descriptions:

- Ask for the primary keyword and page type if not provided.
- Write 3 title tag variants, each under 60 characters, with the primary keyword near the beginning. Use different formulas: question, how-to, number, direct statement.
- Write 3 meta description variants, each under 160 characters, including the primary keyword and a call-to-action verb.
- For each variant, briefly note why it might work (curiosity, specificity, benefit-driven, etc.).
- If the page already has a title/description, provide improved versions with specific explanations of what changed and why.

Never write identical meta copy for multiple pages. Every page needs unique title and description copy.

### 5. Adapting Copy Tone to Search Intent

When writing copy and the search intent is specified (or can be inferred from the keyword):

- **Informational:** Write in an educational, authoritative tone. Lead with explanations and definitions. Use "what," "why," and "how" structures. Provide depth and examples. Do not push a sale.
- **Commercial investigation:** Write in a consultative, balanced tone. Compare options honestly. Use tables, pros/cons lists, and "best for" recommendations. Acknowledge trade-offs.
- **Transactional:** Write in a direct, action-oriented tone. Lead with benefits. Keep paragraphs short. Use urgency (honest, not manufactured). Place CTAs prominently.
- **Navigational:** Write in a clear, branded tone. Confirm the user has found the right place. Minimize friction to the desired destination.

If the user does not specify intent, infer it from the keyword and explain your reasoning.

### 6. SEO Copy Quality Checklist

Before finalizing any SEO copy, run through this checklist and flag any issues:

- [ ] Primary keyword appears in H1, first 100 words, at least one H2, and meta description
- [ ] Title tag is under 60 characters with keyword near the beginning
- [ ] Meta description is under 160 characters with keyword and CTA
- [ ] Heading hierarchy is logical (H1 > H2 > H3, no skipped levels)
- [ ] Paragraphs are 2–4 sentences (web-appropriate length)
- [ ] Lists, tables, or bold text break up dense sections
- [ ] Internal links use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- [ ] No keyword stuffing (read aloud — does it sound natural?)
- [ ] Content matches the search intent of the target keyword
- [ ] E-E-A-T signals are present (sourced claims, experience markers, author context)
- [ ] Content is comprehensive enough to compete with top-ranking pages
- [ ] CTA is present and appropriate for the page type

### 2. Blog Post with SEO Structure

A blog post about email subject lines, demonstrating proper heading hierarchy, keyword placement, and scannable formatting.

<!-- Target keyword: "email subject lines that get opened" -->
<!-- Secondary: email subject line examples, best subject lines, subject line tips -->

<article>
  <h1>Email Subject Lines That Get Opened: 15 Formulas That Work in 2026</h1>

  <p>
    Your email subject line determines whether your message gets opened or
    ignored. With the average professional receiving 121 emails per day,
    <strong>email subject lines that get opened</strong> are the ones that
    earn attention in a crowded inbox — not through tricks, but through
    relevance, clarity, and curiosity.
  </p>

  <p>
    This guide breaks down 15 proven subject line formulas with real examples
    you can adapt for your own campaigns. Whether you are writing a welcome
    sequence, a product launch announcement, or a weekly newsletter, these
    patterns will improve your open rates.

  <h2 id="why-subject-lines-matter">Why Subject Lines Matter More Than Body Copy</h2>

  <p>
    The best email copy in the world is worthless if nobody reads it.
    Subject lines are the gatekeeper — they determine your open rate, which
    determines every downstream metric: clicks, conversions, and revenue.
  </p>

  <p>
    According to campaign data across industries, <strong>47% of email
    recipients open an email based on the subject line alone</strong>. The
    preview text (preheader) is the second factor. The sender name is the
    third. The body copy? It only matters after these three gates are passed.
  </p>

  <h2 id="anatomy">The Anatomy of a High-Performing Subject Line</h2>

  <p>
    Effective subject lines share four characteristics, regardless of
    industry or audience:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Specificity</strong> — "5 CSS tricks for faster load times"
      beats "Tips for your website"</li>
    <li><strong>Relevance</strong> — Segmented sends with targeted subjects
      outperform broadcast blasts</li>
    <li><strong>Urgency or curiosity</strong> — A reason to open now rather
      than "later" (which means never)</li>
    <li><strong>Brevity</strong> — 6–10 words or 30–50 characters to avoid
      mobile truncation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 id="formulas">15 Subject Line Formulas With Examples</h2>

  <h3>Formula 1: The Number List</h3>
  <p>
    Numbers create specificity and set expectations. The reader knows
    exactly what they are getting.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>"7 SEO mistakes killing your traffic"</li>
    <li>"3 pricing page fixes that doubled our conversions"</li>
    <li>"12 email subject line examples you can steal"</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Formula 2: The How-To</h3>
  <p>
    Promise a skill or outcome. Works best for educational content.

    <li>"How we reduced churn by 34% with one email"</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- ... remaining formulas follow the same pattern ... -->

  <h2 id="testing">How to A/B Test Subject Lines</h2>

  <p>
    Never rely on intuition alone. A/B testing subject lines is the most
    reliable way to improve open rates over time. Most email platforms
    (Mailchimp, ConvertKit, Resend) support native A/B testing.
  </p>

  <h3>What to Test</h3>

  <h2 id="mistakes">5 Subject Line Mistakes That Kill Open Rates</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>ALL CAPS</strong> — Triggers spam filters and feels aggressive</li>
    <li><strong>Clickbait that doesn't deliver</strong> — Destroys trust and
      increases unsubscribes</li>
    <li><strong>Too long</strong> — Mobile truncates after ~35 characters on
      most devices</li>
    <li><strong>No preview text</strong> — Wastes the second line of real
      estate in the inbox</li>
    <li><strong>Same subject every week</strong> — Readers stop noticing
      identical patterns</li>
  </ol>
</article>
```

**Key decisions:** The H1 contains the primary keyword at the beginning. The first paragraph uses the keyword in bold within the first two sentences. H2s are descriptive and keyword-adjacent. The table of contents improves navigation for long-form content. Tables, lists, and bold text create a scannable structure. Every section is self-contained so readers who jump via the TOC get a complete answer.

### 3. Meta Copy Variants by Page Type

Title tags and meta descriptions tailored to different page types, demonstrating how intent and context change the copy approach.

```html
<!-- BLOG POST: informational intent -->
<!-- Primary keyword: "how to write product descriptions" -->
<title>How to Write Product Descriptions That Rank and Sell | Brand</title>
<meta name="description" content="Learn the step-by-step process for writing product descriptions that rank in Google and convert browsers into buyers. Includes templates and examples.">

<!-- PRODUCT PAGE: transactional intent -->
<!-- Primary keyword: "wireless noise-cancelling headphones" -->
<title>ProSound X9 Wireless Noise-Cancelling Headphones — 40hr Battery</title>
<meta name="description" content="ProSound X9 delivers studio-quality noise cancellation with 40-hour battery life. Free shipping, 30-day returns. Rated 4.8/5 by 2,300+ customers.">

<!-- CATEGORY PAGE: commercial investigation intent -->
<!-- Primary keyword: "best project management tools" -->
<title>Best Project Management Tools in 2026 (Compared & Tested)</title>
<meta name="description" content="We tested 12 project management tools head-to-head. See honest comparisons of Notion, Linear, Asana, Monday, and more — with pricing, pros, and cons.">

<!-- SERVICE PAGE: commercial intent -->
<!-- Primary keyword: "ecommerce SEO services" -->
<title>Ecommerce SEO Services — More Organic Revenue, Not Just Traffic</title>
<meta name="description" content="Ecommerce SEO that drives revenue, not vanity metrics. Product page optimization, category SEO, and technical fixes. See case studies and pricing.">

<!-- HOMEPAGE: brand + broad keyword -->
<!-- Primary keyword: "Acme project management" -->
<title>Acme — Project Management for Fast-Moving Teams</title>
<meta name="description" content="Acme helps teams plan, track, and ship work faster. Used by 5,000+ teams including Stripe, Vercel, and Linear. Start free — no credit card required.">

<!-- FAQ PAGE: informational / featured snippet intent -->
<!-- Primary keyword: "what is a meta description" -->
<title>What Is a Meta Description? Definition, Examples, Best Practices</title>
<meta name="description" content="A meta description is the 150-160 character summary shown in Google search results. Learn how to write one that earns clicks, with examples for every page type.">
```

**Key decisions:** Each title tag puts the keyword near the beginning and stays under 60 characters. Each meta description includes the keyword (Google bolds it), a specific benefit or proof point, and an action-oriented phrase. The tone shifts to match intent: educational for blog/FAQ, proof-heavy for product, consultative for category, action-oriented for service, trust-building for homepage.

### 4. Product Description with Natural Keyword Integration

A SaaS product description showing natural keyword placement without stuffing.

```html
<!-- Primary keyword: "team communication platform" -->
<!-- Secondary: team messaging app, workplace communication tool, team chat software -->

<section class="product-description">
  <h1>The Team Communication Platform Built for Async-First Work</h1>

  <p>
    Pulse is a <strong>team communication platform</strong> designed for
    distributed teams that operate across time zones. Unlike chat tools that
    demand instant replies, Pulse is built around thoughtful, threaded
    conversations that respect focus time while keeping everyone aligned.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Teams Switch to Pulse</h2>

  <div class="benefit">
    <h3>Threaded Conversations, Not Chat Noise</h3>
    <p>
      Every discussion in Pulse lives in a thread with context. No more
      scrolling through 200 messages to find the decision. Teams using our
      <strong>workplace communication tool</strong> report 40% fewer
      meetings within the first month.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="benefit">
    <h3>Async by Default, Real-Time When Needed</h3>
    <p>
      Pulse treats asynchronous communication as the default mode.
      Team members respond on their own schedule. When you need real-time
      collaboration, one-click huddles bring the team together instantly.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="benefit">
    <h3>Search That Actually Works</h3>
    <p>
      Find any conversation, decision, or file in seconds. Pulse indexes
      every message, document, and thread — so your team's knowledge is
      never lost in a chat scroll. Unlike other <strong>team messaging
      apps</strong>, search results show full thread context, not isolated
      messages.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Built for Teams of Every Size</h2>

  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Plan</th>
        <th>Users</th>
        <th>Features</th>
        <th>Price</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Free</td>
        <td>Up to 10</td>
        <td>Threads, search, file sharing</td>
        <td>$0/month</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Team</td>
        <td>Up to 100</td>
        <td>Everything in Free + huddles, integrations, analytics</td>
        <td>$8/user/month</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Enterprise</td>
        <td>Unlimited</td>
        <td>Everything in Team + SSO, audit logs, dedicated support</td>
        <td>Custom pricing</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

  <p>
    Whether you are a 5-person startup or a 500-person company, Pulse
    gives your team a structured <strong>team chat software</strong>
    experience that scales without the noise.
  </p>
</section>
```

**Key decisions:** The primary keyword appears in the H1 and first paragraph. Secondary keywords ("workplace communication tool," "team messaging apps," "team chat software") appear once each in natural contexts. No keyword is repeated more than twice on the page. Each mention adds meaning to the sentence rather than feeling inserted. The description leads with benefits, includes a pricing table (structured for potential rich snippets), and maintains a conversational tone throughout.

### 5. SEO Copy Audit — Before and After

A real-world optimization showing how to improve underperforming SEO copy.

```text
BEFORE (Original copy — ranking position 18, CTR 0.3%)
===========================================================

Title tag: "Our Services | Acme Digital"
Meta description: (none set — Google auto-generated from page content)

Page copy:
-----------

PROBLEMS IDENTIFIED:
1. Title tag is generic — no keyword, no value proposition
2. No meta description — Google generates a poor one from vague body copy
3. H1 is "Services" — no keyword, could be any company in any industry
4. Body copy is vague — no specific services, no outcomes, no proof
5. "Wide range" and "experts" and "years of experience" are empty phrases
6. No E-E-A-T signals — no specifics, no case studies, no numbers
7. "We are the best" is an unsupported superlative
8. No internal links to individual service pages
9. No structured data
10. Copy reads like it was written to fill space, not to inform or convert


AFTER (Optimized copy — ranking position 4, CTR 4.2%)
===========================================================

Title tag: "Digital Marketing Services — SEO, PPC & Content | Acme"
Meta description: "Acme provides SEO, PPC, and content marketing services
for B2B SaaS companies. 47 clients served, avg. 3.2x organic traffic
growth. See case studies and pricing."

Page copy:
-----------

  <li><strong>Transparent reporting:</strong> Real-time dashboards with
    metrics that matter — pipeline influenced, not just keyword rankings.</li>
  <li><strong>Proven results:</strong> 47 clients, 3.2x average organic
    growth, 92% client retention rate.</li>
</ul>

WHAT CHANGED:
1. Title tag includes primary keyword + services listed + brand (59 chars)
2. Meta description includes keyword, proof points, and CTA (158 chars)
3. H1 specifies the niche (B2B SaaS) + primary keyword
4. Opening paragraph has specific numbers (47 clients, 3.2x growth)
5. Each service section links to its dedicated page (internal linking)
6. Vague claims replaced with specific metrics and outcomes
7. E-E-A-T: specific experience, verifiable numbers, focused expertise
8. "Best" replaced with evidence-based differentiators
9. CTA on each section directs to deeper pages (supports cluster structure)
10. Copy answers the commercial-intent query: "do I want to hire this agency?"
```

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Keyword Stuffing

**Wrong:** Forcing the target keyword into every sentence, making the copy sound robotic and repetitive. "Our SEO copywriting services provide the best SEO copywriting for businesses that need SEO copywriting. If you need SEO copywriting, our SEO copywriting team delivers expert SEO copywriting."

**Fix:** Use the primary keyword in the H1, first paragraph, one H2, and meta description. Beyond that, use natural variations, synonyms, and semantic terms. Read the copy aloud — if it sounds like a human wrote it for another human, the keyword integration is correct.

### 2. Writing for Search Engines Only

**Wrong:** Creating content that answers Google's algorithmic signals (keywords in the right places, correct word count, heading structure) but provides no genuine value to the reader. The copy technically checks every SEO box but reads like a template filled with generic advice that could apply to any topic.

**Fix:** Start by writing the best possible answer to the searcher's question, as if SEO did not exist. Then verify the SEO fundamentals are in place. Quality content that lacks perfect optimization will outperform perfectly optimized content that lacks quality.

### 3. Ignoring Search Intent

**Wrong:** Writing a 3,000-word educational guide for a transactional keyword like "buy standing desk," or writing a 200-word product blurb for an informational keyword like "how to choose a standing desk." The content does not match what the searcher expects.

**Fix:** Before writing, search the target keyword in Google and look at the top 5 results. What format are they? How long are they? What tone do they use? Align your content format, length, and tone with what is already ranking — then make it better.

### 4. Using the Same Meta Copy Across Pages

**Wrong:** Every page on the site has the same title tag template ("Page Name | Brand") and either no meta description or the same company boilerplate description. This wastes the highest-leverage copy opportunity on the site and signals thin content to Google.

**Fix:** Write unique, keyword-targeted title tags and meta descriptions for every indexable page. Treat each one as a 60-character ad headline and 160-character ad copy. Pages without unique meta copy are pages without a compelling reason to click.

### 5. Burying the Primary Keyword Below the Fold

**Wrong:** The primary keyword does not appear until the third or fourth paragraph because the writer started with a lengthy anecdote, a rhetorical question, or a generic introduction. Both readers and search engines need to understand the page topic immediately.

**Fix:** Mention the primary keyword within the first 100 words — ideally in the first sentence or two. You can still use a hook or anecdote, but weave the keyword into it rather than deferring it.

### 6. Generic Anchor Text for Internal Links

**Wrong:** Internal links that use "click here," "read more," "learn more," or "this article" as anchor text. These phrases tell Google nothing about the linked page's content and waste an opportunity to reinforce topical relevance.

**Fix:** Use descriptive, keyword-relevant anchor text that naturally describes the linked page. "Learn how to [build a content cluster](link)" tells both the reader and Google exactly what they will find on the linked page.

### 7. No Content Brief Before Writing

**Wrong:** Starting to write SEO content from a blank page with only a keyword in mind. The resulting content rambles, misses key subtopics, targets the wrong intent, and is either too thin or too unfocused to compete with established pages.

**Fix:** Always create or request a content brief before writing. The brief defines the keyword, intent, audience, required sections, competitive benchmarks, and unique angle. Even a 10-minute brief produces dramatically better content than an hour of unplanned writing.

### 8. Optimizing for Zero-Search-Volume Keywords

**Wrong:** Spending time writing comprehensive content for keywords that nobody searches for. The content may be excellent, but if the target keyword has zero or near-zero monthly search volume, it will never attract meaningful organic traffic.

**Fix:** Validate keyword search volume before writing. Use Google Search Console, keyword research tools, or even Google's autocomplete to confirm that real people search for the term. Some low-volume keywords are strategic (very high conversion intent), but this should be a deliberate choice, not an oversight.

### 9. Forgetting E-E-A-T Signals

**Wrong:** Publishing content with no author attribution, no sources or citations, no specific experience markers, and generic advice that could have been written by anyone with five minutes of research. The content may technically target the right keywords but lacks the trust signals that Google's quality guidelines emphasize.

**Fix:** Include author bios with relevant credentials. Cite specific sources with links. Include first-hand experience, original data, or specific case studies. Display "last updated" dates. Make claims specific and verifiable rather than vague and aspirational.

### 10. Not Measuring Copy Performance

**Wrong:** Publishing content and moving on without tracking how it performs in search. Months later, the page ranks on page 4 for a keyword it could rank on page 1 for — but nobody noticed because nobody checked.

**Fix:** Set up a regular review cadence (monthly or quarterly). Check Google Search Console for position, impressions, and CTR. Identify pages with high impressions but low CTR (meta copy problem), pages with declining position (content freshness problem), and pages with high bounce rates (intent mismatch problem). Update and improve content based on data, not assumptions.
