# Digital PR

> Digital PR is the practice of earning high-authority backlinks and brand coverage through newsworthy content, data-driven stories, and media relationships. It's link building meets public relations.

---

## Principles

### 1. What Digital PR Achieves
- **High-authority backlinks** from news outlets (DR 80-95)
- **Brand awareness** and recognition
- **Topical authority signals** from contextually relevant coverage
- **E-E-A-T signals** (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)
- **Referral traffic** from high-traffic publications

### 2. Types of Digital PR Campaigns

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Data studies** | Original research with newsworthy findings | "We analyzed 10M websites and found..." |
| **Surveys** | Poll-based insights on trending topics | "73% of marketers say AI changed their workflow" |
| **Reactive PR (Newsjacking)** | Jumping on breaking news with expert commentary | Expert quote on a trending algorithm update |
| **Product PR** | Newsworthy product launches or features | "Company launches free SEO audit tool" |
| **Stunt / Creative** | Unusual, shareable campaigns | Interactive map, quiz, or visual content |
| **Expert commentary** | Providing quotes and insights to journalists | Journalist query platforms (Qwoted, Featured) |

### 3. The Newsworthy Test
Before pitching, your story must pass this test:
- **Is it new?** First-of-its-kind data, study, or insight
- **Is it interesting?** Would a journalist's readers care?
- **Is it timely?** Related to current events or trends
- **Is it surprising?** Challenges assumptions or reveals something unexpected
- **Is it relevant?** To the publication's audience

### 4. Finding Journalists and Publications
- **Journalist query platforms:** Qwoted, Featured, Help a B2B Writer, Source of Sources (note: HARO/Connectively shut down in June 2024)
- **Twitter/X lists:** Follow journalists in your niche
- **Media databases:** Muck Rack, Cision, BuzzStream
- **Google News:** Search your topic, find who covers it
- **Competitor coverage:** Who wrote about your competitors? They'll likely cover you too.

### 5. The Pitch
Journalists receive 100+ pitches daily. Yours must:
- Have a compelling subject line (the hook)
- Lead with the key finding/news in the first sentence
- Include ready-to-publish data/quotes
- Be under 200 words
- Not be salesy — this is not an ad

## LLM Instructions

```
You are a digital PR strategist. When planning or executing a digital PR campaign:

1. IDENTIFY newsworthy angles:
   - What unique data does the client have access to?
   - What industry trends can be analyzed or quantified?
   - What controversial or surprising findings can be surfaced?
   - What current news events can be tied to the client's expertise?

2. CREATE campaign assets:
   - Data study with clear methodology
   - Key findings (3-5 headline-worthy stats)
   - Visual assets (charts, infographics, maps)
   - Expert quotes ready for journalists to copy
   - Landing page for the study (link target)

3. BUILD media lists:
   - Identify 50-100 relevant journalists per campaign
   - Segment by: tier 1 (national), tier 2 (industry), tier 3 (niche)
   - Research their recent articles and interests
   - Find email patterns or use media databases

4. WRITE pitch emails:
   - Subject line: [Key Finding] + [Relevance Hook]
   - First line: The most surprising stat or finding
   - Body: 2-3 supporting data points
   - Close: Offer for exclusive data, interview, or custom angle
   - Attach or link to visual assets

5. EXECUTE outreach:
   - Tier 1 gets exclusives (offer first)
   - Tier 2 gets the general pitch after exclusive period
   - Follow up once after 3-5 days (never more than twice)
   - Track opens and responses

6. MEASURE success:
   - Number of placements (links)
   - Average DR of linking domains
   - Estimated link value
   - Brand mention reach
   - Referral traffic from coverage

Output: Campaign brief with angle, key data points, target publications,
pitch email draft, and success metrics.

## Examples

### Example 1: Data Study Campaign
```
CAMPAIGN: "The State of Website Speed in 2025"

ANGLE: We crawled 1 million websites and analyzed their Core Web Vitals
scores. The findings reveal surprising gaps between industries.

KEY FINDINGS:
1. Only 33% of e-commerce sites pass all Core Web Vitals
2. Healthcare sites are the slowest industry (avg LCP: 4.2s)
3. Sites that pass CWV have 23% lower bounce rates
4. Mobile performance is 40% worse than desktop across all industries

ASSETS:
- Full report landing page: /research/website-speed-2025/
- Interactive industry comparison tool
- Downloadable infographic
- 5 quotable data visualizations

MEDIA LIST:
- Tier 1: Search Engine Journal, Search Engine Land, TechCrunch
- Tier 2: Moz Blog, Ahrefs Blog, Smashing Magazine
- Tier 3: Industry-specific publications (healthcare, e-commerce blogs)

PITCH SUBJECT: "Only 33% of E-commerce Sites Pass Google's Speed Test [New Study]"
```

### Example 2: Digital PR Pitch Email
```
Subject: 73% of remote workers report "Zoom fatigue" — new study

Hi [Journalist Name],

Our team surveyed 5,000 remote workers across 12 industries
and found that 73% experience regular video call fatigue —
but the solutions aren't what you'd expect.

Key findings:
→ "Camera-off" policies reduced fatigue by 45%
→ Walking meetings increased productivity scores by 32%
→ The most fatigued industry? Education (not tech)

The full study includes demographic breakdowns and industry
comparisons. Happy to share the data set or arrange an
interview with our head of research.

Full report: [URL]

Best,
[Name]
```

### Example 3: Reactive PR / Newsjacking
```
TRIGGER: Google announces a new algorithm update

RESPONSE (within 24 hours):
1. Analyze early impact data from your client's sites
2. Draft expert commentary with actionable insights
3. Create a quick data visualization
4. Pitch to SEO/tech journalists:

"Hi [Name], with Google's [update name] rolling out today,
we've already analyzed the impact across 500 sites.
Early data shows [finding]. [Expert name] is available
for comment on what this means for [audience].
Quick stats attached."
```

## Common Mistakes
- **Pitching without a news angle:** "We exist" is not news. "We found X surprising thing" is.
- **Mass emailing generic pitches:** Journalists can smell a template. Personalize.
- **No visual assets:** Journalists need ready-to-publish images and charts.
- **Following up too aggressively:** One follow-up is fine. Three is spam.
- **Not having a landing page:** If you earn a link, it should point to a permanent, valuable page — not a PDF or gated content.
- **Ignoring smaller publications:** Tier 3 sites are easier to earn and still pass meaningful link equity.
